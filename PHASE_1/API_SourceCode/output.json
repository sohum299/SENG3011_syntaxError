    "headline": "SOUTH AFRICA - Western Cape Girl Diagnosed With Malaria - Infection Potentially Linked To Mozambique",
    "main_text": "A young Western Cape girl presented with fever, seizures and diarrhoea for nearly two months.  She was eventually diagnosed with malaria.  The NICD suspected a case of \"odyssean malaria\", believing it could be traced to a neighbour who had travelled to Mozambique.  Western Cape healthcare workers were baffled when a 7-year-old girl had symptoms of fever, seizures and diarrhoea for nearly two months.  In its monthly communique, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said the girl first went for a check-up in December after having two seizures at home. She had a third one at a local clinic.  The NICD said:  On examination, she was febrile (38.4degC) and had mild dehydration, with the rest of the examination being normal. She was admitted to Red Cross Hospital for a CT brain scan, which was normal. Blood work was congruent with the clinical picture of mild dehydration. She was discharged on 28 December 2021.  But, about two weeks later, she went to the hospital again for diarrhoea and vomiting. Her temperature was 39.8degC, and she was discharged after being given oral rehydration therapy.    Three days later, she was back at the hospital with ongoing vomiting and fever. They performed an electroencephalogram (EEG) on her to check if she might have epilepsy. Her blood work, the NICD said, showed anaemia, thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), and the presence of malaria parasites, with a subsequent diagnosis of cerebral malaria.  \"She commenced IV artesunate and recovered fully. As she had no recent history of travel to a malaria-endemic area, her illness was termed odyssean malaria.\"  Precautionary advisory  The NICD said a full environmental investigation was done to try and figure out how she got the disease.  It said:  No vector source was found at the patient's usual places of residence, and the only potential link to a source was a neighbour who was confirmed to have travelled from Mozambique in the last week of December. Thankfully, no additional malaria cases were diagnosed in the area.  According to the NICD, odyssean malaria is also known as airport, suitcase, minibus, or taxi-rank malaria. It is likely that a malaria vector mosquito, accidentally transported from a malaria area, was responsible.    This is not the first time someone with no history of travel has been infected with malaria. In 2017, four cases of malaria were reported in Kilner Park, Pretoria, affecting people with no recent history of travel. At the time, the NICD said that between 2007 and 2017, over 69 cases of odyssean malaria had been reported in the country, mostly in Gauteng.  The NICD said as a precautionary measure, healthcare facilities in the district were advised to be suspicious of malaria in individuals presenting with \"flu-like illnesses\".  \"This presentation of delayed diagnosis of malaria, as well as complicated malaria, is typical in odyssean malaria cases. Healthcare workers should check for malaria in patients with recurrent unexplained pyrexia even with no history of travel, to prevent delayed diagnosis and subsequent complications.\"  We want to hear your views on the news.

    "main_text": "A fifth case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Indiana has been confirmed.  A commercial flock of 35,908 turkeys in Dubois County, which had earlier been identified as a presumed-positive case of avian influenza has since been confirmed to have contracted a H5N1 variant of HPAI, according to information made available by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH).  All turkeys in the flock have been depopulated.  This marks the third confirmation of HPAI in commercial turkey flock in Dubois County in 2022. The two earlier cases were confirmed on February 8 and February 16, and contained 29,000 and 26,473 turkeys, respectively.  One February 23, one day prior to the confirmation of HPAI's presence in the third Dubois County flock, two earlier presumed-positive cases of HPAI in Greene County turkey flocks were confirmed. The Greene County flocks included 48,000 and 15,400 turkeys.  Advertisement  In addition to the five cases of HPAI in Indiana, there have also been confirmed cases of HPAI in commercial poultry in Kentucky and Delaware.  Those cases included a flock of 1,146,937 commercial laying hens in New Castle County, Delaware; a flock of 246,000 commercial broilers in Fulton County, Kentucky, and a flock of 54,600 commercial turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.  To date, the only other commercial poultry flock in North America to have a confirmed case of HPAI was a commercial turkey flock in Nova Scotia, Canada. The first appearance of HPAI in North America this winter occurred at an exhibition farm in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. That case was confirmed in December 2021.  HPAI cases have also been reported in poultry this year in the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia.  View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.",

    "headline": "INDIANA - State Officials - Bird Flu Found At 6th Indiana Turkey Farm",
    "main_text": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Avian influenza has been detected ina sixth commercial poultry flock in southern Indiana, state officials said Tuesday.  Laboratory testing of a fourth commercial turkey flock in Dubois County has come back as presumptively positive for the virus, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said. The samples are being verified at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa.  Three previous cases were found in Dubois County and two in Greene County. Cases have also been detected in Michigan, in a backyard flock and in a zoo.  Pending test results should indicate if it is the same strain of the virus that has been found elsewhere and if it is highly pathogenic.  Officials have begun euthanizing the 16,500 birds at the latest farm to prevent the spread of the disease.  Animal Health Board staff have reached out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the area to schedule testing of birds there, it said.  The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S.  The turkey infections are the first confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has said.  A January 2016 outbreak of bird flu in Dubois County affected 11 poultry farms, resulting in the loss of more than 400,000 birds, the Animal Health Board said.  Indiana ranks third nationally in turkey production.",

The restricted zone surrounding the Welshpool site crosses the Shropshire border, with signs placed on the road to indicate people are entering an animal disease control area.  Powys is also home to a significant number of chicken farms, increasing concern around the spread of the disease.  Both cases were confirmed by the Welsh Government on February 21.  Speaking at the time the chief veterinary officer for Wales, Professor Christianne Glossop, said: \"These cases of avian influenza in Wales are a cause for concern, and evidence the risk to our birds has not diminished.  \"Keepers of birds must be vigilant and ensure they have the very highest levels of biosecurity in place.
