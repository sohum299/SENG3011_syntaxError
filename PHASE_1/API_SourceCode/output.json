    "main_text": "Victorian health authorities have confirmed a man in his 60s died from the mosquito-borne Japanese Encephalitis Virus.  A Victorian man in his 60s has died after contracting the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV).  Victorian health authorities confirmed an autopsy had revealed his death on February 28 was due to the deadly virus.  This is the first fatality from the virus in Victoria from seven confirmed JEV cases.  Victoria Health is now conducting investigations into how the man contracted the deadly virus.  JEV is spread by mosquitoes and can infect both animals and humans and has been confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in regional NSW.  The virus can cause serious illness, such as encephalitis, in roughly one per cent of those who are infected.  A man in his 60s has died in Victoria from the Japanese Encephalitis Virus which is carried by mosquitos.

On Monday New South Wales had two residents hospitalised with JEV while Queensland last week issued an urgent health alert after a human case was recorded.  NSW Health on Monday confirmed a man and a child from the NSW-Victoria border region were receiving hospital treatment.  The man remains in a serious condition in ICU while the child was discharged from intensive care but remains in hospital due to the \"serious nature\" of their illness.  The Queensland case was a resident who recently travelled in regional southern Queensland and is in a Brisbane hospital.  Agriculture Minister David Littleproud explained the cause of the rise in cases as he admitted the government was concerned but not panicking.  \"We're monitoring it closely with state agencies as well but effectively it's come about from the significant wet weather that we've had spread right across the eastern seaboard,\" he told Sky News political editor.  The majority of those who contract JEV will experience none or very mild symptoms and have a full recovery.  However health authorities have warned those who develop a sudden onset of fever, headache, vomiting as well as seizures or disorientation should immediately seek medical attention.  Children aged under five and older people infected with JEV are at a higher risk of developing severe illnesses such as encephalitis.  There are JEV vaccines available and health authorities recommend them to anyone who works with or around pigs including transport workers, vets visiting pig farms and people hunting pigs.  itabuna, bahia, brazil - june 15, 2012: pig breeding in a pigsty on a farm in the city of Itabuna, in southern Bahia.  Mr Littleproud said the government was working to ensure those people in risk areas were getting their vaccine.  \"We're trying to really narrow down those risk areas to make sure that it is a targeted approach and that approach is around vaccines,\" he said.  The Agriculture Minister said the government had about 6,000 vaccines in storage before cases emerged and had ordered another 6,000 from Korea with more on the way.  \"To make sure that if this does get further than the 21 piggeries across the east coast and South Australia that we will be able to target this,\" he said.  Mr Littleproud said the government had handed the vaccines to the state governments who were targeting those working in piggeries.  \"They've been targeting some local communities but local health authorities are working through that,\" he said.  \"We're trying to act within both Health and Agriculture to move quickly to get vaccines but also to make sure that councils are doing work around trying to eradicate mosquitoes in some of those areas where there's water laying.\"",

    "main_text": "NSW's first-ever locally acquired human cases of the potentially deadly Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) have been detected in a man and a child living near the border with Victoria.  Key points: Health authorities expect more cases to be diagnosed over the next few days  Health authorities expect more cases to be diagnosed over the next few days NSW Health says people must avoid being bitten by mosquitoes  NSW Health says people must avoid being bitten by mosquitoes The virus outbreak has been declared an incident of national significance by the Acting Chief Medical Officer  Health officials say other patients are being tested for the mosquito-borne virus and more cases are expected to be confirmed in coming days.  One of the cases, a man from the Corowa area, was the probable case first reported by NSW Health on Friday.  The man remains in a serious condition in an ICU ward at a Victorian hospital.  The second case is a child from the Wentworth area in the far south-west of NSW. The child has been discharged from ICU but continues to receive hospital care.  NSW Health is concerned about the spread of JEV in the border region and is calling on the community to take care not to be bitten by mosquitoes.  JEV has now been detected in four Australian states. ( ABC Rural Angus Mackintosh )  JEV is an illness developed in pigs and horses and spread by infected mosquitoes.  It can be fatal for humans, however, less than 1 per cent of infected people develop symptoms.  The virus has now been detected in four Australian states, an outbreak which has been declared a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance by the Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sonya Bennett.  There is a vaccine but no specific treatment for JEV, which can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.  The virus cannot be spread person-to-person or through eating animals.  Mosquito control activities are being carried out near farms where pigs are confirmed to have been infected by JEV, and NSW Health is arranging vaccination of workers on affected farms.  NSW Health acting chief health officer Dr Marianne Gale said the best thing people can do to protect themselves against JEV is to take steps to avoid mosquito bites.  \"We are working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and other states and territories to determine the extent to which the virus is circulating,\" Dr Gale said.  \"Unfortunately, our recent wet weather has led to very high mosquito numbers, so we need the community to be particularly vigilant and take steps to avoid mosquito bites.  \"We know mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn, and we need people planning activities near waterways or where mosquitoes are present to be especially cautious, particularly those in the vicinity of the Murray River and its branches.\"",
