  "main_text": "Victorian health authorities have confirmed a man in his 60s died from the mosquito-borne Japanese Encephalitis Virus.  A Victorian man in his 60s has died after contracting the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV).  Victorian health authorities confirmed an autopsy had revealed his death on February 28 was due to the deadly virus.  This is the first fatality from the virus in Victoria from seven confirmed JEV cases.  Victoria Health is now conducting investigations into how the man contracted the deadly virus.  JEV is spread by mosquitoes and can infect both animals and humans and has been confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in regional NSW.  The virus can cause serious illness, such as encephalitis, in roughly one per cent of those who are infected.  A man in his 60s has died in Victoria from the Japanese Encephalitis Virus which is carried by mosquitos.

On Monday New South Wales had two residents hospitalised with JEV while Queensland last week issued an urgent health alert after a human case was recorded.  NSW Health on Monday confirmed a man and a child from the NSW-Victoria border region were receiving hospital treatment.  The man remains in a serious condition in ICU while the child was discharged from intensive care but remains in hospital due to the \"serious nature\" of their illness.  The Queensland case was a resident who recently travelled in regional southern Queensland and is in a Brisbane hospital.  Agriculture Minister David Littleproud explained the cause of the rise in cases as he admitted the government was concerned but not panicking.  \"We're monitoring it closely with state agencies as well but effectively it's come about from the significant wet weather that we've had spread right across the eastern seaboard,\" he told Sky News political editor.  The majority of those who contract JEV will experience none or very mild symptoms and have a full recovery.  However health authorities have warned those who develop a sudden onset of fever, headache, vomiting as well as seizures or disorientation should immediately seek medical attention.  Children aged under five and older people infected with JEV are at a higher risk of developing severe illnesses such as encephalitis.  There are JEV vaccines available and health authorities recommend them to anyone who works with or around pigs including transport workers, vets visiting pig farms and people hunting pigs.  itabuna, bahia, brazil - june 15, 2012: pig breeding in a pigsty on a farm in the city of Itabuna, in southern Bahia.  Mr Littleproud said the government was working to ensure those people in risk areas were getting their vaccine.  \"We're trying to really narrow down those risk areas to make sure that it is a targeted approach and that approach is around vaccines,\" he said.  The Agriculture Minister said the government had about 6,000 vaccines in storage before cases emerged and had ordered another 6,000 from Korea with more on the way.  \"To make sure that if this does get further than the 21 piggeries across the east coast and South Australia that we will be able to target this,\" he said.  Mr Littleproud said the government had handed the vaccines to the state governments who were targeting those working in piggeries.  \"They've been targeting some local communities but local health authorities are working through that,\" he said.  \"We're trying to act within both Health and Agriculture to move quickly to get vaccines but also to make sure that councils are doing work around trying to eradicate mosquitoes in some of those areas where there's water laying.\"",

A rat looks on in the Saint Jacques Tower park, in the center of Paris, Friday, Dec. 9, 2016. (AP photo)  TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- A worker at a horse ranch in the north has been diagnosed with hantavirus, the first case in Taiwan this year.  The patient, who is in his 40s, has no travel history and is believed to have contracted the virus from contact with mice feces at the workplace. Rats, the carrier of the virus, are frequently sighted at the farm he works at, according to the man.  He started exhibiting symptoms of the disease including fever, chills, and muscle pain on Feb. 12. The symptoms persisted, so he sought medical assistance on Feb. 14, after which he was hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus, said the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  The man has been discharged from the hospital and is in stable condition. Contacts and people who live with him have not shown symptoms, while disinfection and an investigation have been carried out at the horse ranch.  Taiwan reported ten hantavirus cases in 2021, including people in Kaohsiung, Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Changhua, and Taichung, per the CDC.  Hantavirus is contracted through contact with rodent urine or feces, rodent bites, or objects contaminated with the virus. Some strains could result in severe diseases in humans, such as hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which may cause diarrhea, vomiting, renal failure, and even death.  People are advised to sanitize their living environment and storage facilities with a diluted bleach solution to prevent the spread of the disease.",

To date, more than 160 cases of infection have been reported, which include 28 hospitals in all four health regions.  NIPH coordinates an outbreak group with professionals from all health regions. These work systematically to get the best possible overview of the situation and to limit the outbreak that was first discovered in November at UNN Tromso.  It is probably a combination of infection between people and between people and the environment. Therefore, we are also looking for a possible common source of infection such as medical equipment or other products, says chief physician Kirsten Gravningen at FHI.  Each case of infection is carefully reviewed, and the information is compiled and analyzed. The hospitals have systems for caring for infected people, and very few have become seriously ill.  Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common bacterium that thrives in water and humid environments, as well as in a hospital environment. It rarely causes disease in healthy people, but can cause serious infection in intensive care patients and patients with weakened immune systems.

  "main_text": "Businesses, schools and residents with poultry and captive birds are being asked to keep them indoors where possible to reduce the risk of spreading bird flu after the discovery at the iconic property.  Residents and visitors to the abbey, which dates back to the 13th Century and has large grounds including ponds and lakes, are advised not to feed wild birds and not to touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that they find.  Dog owners are also advised to keep their pets on a lead and take reasonable precautions to reduce exposure to wild waterfowl to minimise the risk of transferring the virus into bird-keeping areas.  Bird flu cases have been confirmed at Newstead Abbey  If anyone finds dead swans, geese or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, they should report them to the Defra helpline on 0345 933 5577.  Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months and other wildlife spread the disease, so it is vital to not allow wild birds to mix with chickens, ducks, geese or other birds.  Public health advice remains that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. There is no impact on the consumption of properly cooked poultry products including eggs.  To limit the spread of disease, the Government introduced housing measures in November which means that all bird keepers - whether it is someone who has pet birds or a few chickens, ducks or geese in the back yard to holders of commercial flocks - are legally required to keep them housed and to follow strict biosecurity measures. If strict biosecurity measures are maintained by poultry keepers, the risk of an outbreak of the disease would be low at their premises.  If anyone finds dead swans, geese or other dead wild birds,report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77  Advice  Key advice for poultry keepers includes to:  House or net all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds;  Cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds - if practical, use disposable protective clothing;  Reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control;  Thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis;  Keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points;  Minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds.  These housing measures will be kept under regular review.  Although the risk to human health from the virus is low, people can catch bird flu via direct contact with a live or dead bird carrying the virus or via direct contact with bird faeces from a bird carrying the virus.",

  "main_text": "A second outbreak of the bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in northwest Iowa's Buena Vista County.  State Veterinarian Michael Kaisand says the birds were about 15 weeks old, and all 50,000 birds were destroyed. Doctor Kaisand says a six-mile quarantine area has been set up around the turkey farm.  He says they've identified five other commercial farms in the area and at least 37 backyard farms in the area as well. They are not releasing the name and location of the infected farm.  The disease was first discovered in a backyard flock of chickens and ducks in southwest Iowa's Pottawattamie County last week. Iowa Ag Secretary Mike Naig, says this is a serious situation -- but the state and producers are much better prepared than they were prior to the devastating bird flu outbreak in 2015.  Naig says there's a lot more awareness now and there has been a significant amount of work done by the industry to evaluate and improve biosecurity and improve the response. Naig says there are potential trade and market implications when the disease hits a commercial flock -- but says it's too soon to tell.  \"I think it's too soon to be concerned about food impact or pricing impact at this point, but you have to acknowledge that that can be an issue over time,\" according to Naig.  Governor Kim Reynolds has issued a disaster proclamation for the county. This allows the state to pool resources to track, monitor, detect and contain the disease. It will also help with turkey disposal and cleanup.",

The department says this is the state's first confirmed case of H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) since 2015.  \"While Nebraska has not seen HPAI in a backyard or commercial poultry flock within the state this year, the finding of this single goose adds Nebraska to a long list of states with confirmed cases of HPAI,\" said Dr. Roger Dudley, the state veterinarian. \"Infected wild birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, so we encourage backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks to continue to remain vigilant, practice good biosecurity and report sick or dying birds immediately.\"  Symptoms of HPAI in poultry include a decrease in water consumption, lack of energy and appetite and decreased egg production, according to NDA. HPAI can also cause sudden death in birds even if they don't show symptoms.  Poultry owners are asked to call NDA at 402-471-2351 to report unusual bird deaths or sick birds.

The public health agency said in a statement that 12 additional deaths and 90 new infections were recorded in the country between February 21 and February 27. The new cases were recorded in 12 states.  With the 98 deaths so far recorded, the NCDC said the case fatality rate in the country is at 18.1 percent, which is lower than the 22.8 percent recorded for the same period in 2021.  Lassa fever is usually transmitted when the saliva, urine, and excreta of the multi-mammalian rats come into contact with humans. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through contact with the body fluids of an infected person.  In some cases, Lassa fever has similar symptoms to malaria, appearing between one and three weeks after exposure to the virus. In mild cases, the disease causes fever, fatigue, weakness, and headache.  The NCDC said it remained committed to supporting state public health teams to achieve the goal of reducing the Lassa fever case fatality rate to a single digit.  The disease control agency said it is currently distributing medical response commodities to states and treatment centers, as part of measures to control the spread of the disease.  On January 26, the NCDC said it had activated the national multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary Lassa fever emergency operations center in response to the outbreak in the country.",
