  "main_text": "Victorian health authorities have confirmed a man in his 60s died from the mosquito-borne Japanese Encephalitis Virus.A Victorian man in his 60s has died after contracting the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV).Victorian health authorities confirmed an autopsy had revealed his death on February 28 was due to the deadly virus.This is the first fatality from the virus in Victoria from seven confirmed JEV cases.Victoria Health is now conducting investigations into how the man contracted the deadly virus.JEV is spread by mosquitoes and can infect both animals and humans and has been confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in regional NSW.The virus can cause serious illness, such as encephalitis, in roughly one per cent of those who are infected.Stream more national news live & on demand with Flash, Australia's biggest news streaming service. New to Flash? Try 1 month free now.On Monday New South Wales had two residents hospitalised with JEV while Queensland last week issued an urgent health alert after a human case was recorded.NSW Health on Monday confirmed a man and a child from the NSW-Victoria border region were receiving hospital treatment.The man remains in a serious condition in ICU while the child was discharged from intensive care but remains in hospital due to the \u201cserious nature\u201d of their illness.The Queensland case was a resident who recently travelled in regional southern Queensland and is in a Brisbane hospital.Agriculture Minister David Littleproud explained the cause of the rise in cases as he admitted the government was concerned but not panicking.\u201cWe\u2019re monitoring it closely with state agencies as well but effectively it\u2019s come about from the significant wet weather that we\u2019ve had spread right across the eastern seaboard,\u201d he told Sky News political editor.The majority of those who contract JEV will experience none or very mild symptoms and have a full recovery.However health authorities have warned those who develop a sudden onset of fever, headache, vomiting as well as seizures or disorientation should immediately seek medical attention.Children aged under five and older people infected with JEV are at a higher risk of developing severe illnesses such as encephalitis.There are JEV vaccines available and health authorities recommend them to anyone who works with or around pigs including transport workers, vets visiting pig farms and people hunting pigs.Mr Littleproud said the government was working to ensure those people in risk areas were getting their vaccine.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really narrow down those risk areas to make sure that it is a targeted approach and that approach is around vaccines,\u201d he said.The Agriculture Minister said the government had about 6,000 vaccines in storage before cases emerged and had ordered another 6,000 from Korea with more on the way.\u201cTo make sure that if this does get further than the 21 piggeries across the east coast and South Australia that we will be able to target this,\u201d he said.Mr Littleproud said the government had handed the vaccines to the state governments who were targeting those working in piggeries.\u201cThey\u2019ve been targeting some local communities but local health authorities are working through that,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to act within both Health and Agriculture to move quickly to get vaccines but also to make sure that councils are doing work around trying to eradicate mosquitoes in some of those areas where there\u2019s water laying.\u201dTo join the conversation, please\n log in.

Rats, the carrier of the virus, are frequently sighted at the farm he works at, according to the man.He started exhibiting symptoms of the disease including fever, chills, and muscle pain on Feb. 12. The symptoms persisted, so he sought medical assistance on Feb. 14, after which he was hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus, said the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The man has been discharged from the hospital and is in stable condition. Contacts and people who live with him have not shown symptoms, while disinfection and an investigation have been carried out at the horse ranch.Taiwan reported ten hantavirus cases in 2021, including people in Kaohsiung, Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Changhua, and Taichung, per the CDC.Hantavirus is contracted through contact with rodent urine or feces, rodent bites, or objects contaminated with the virus. Some strains could result in severe diseases in humans, such as hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which may cause diarrhea, vomiting, renal failure, and even death.People are advised to sanitize their living environment and storage facilities with a diluted bleach solution to prevent the spread of the disease.Updated : 2022-03-14 13:09 GMT+08:00Taiwan News  \u00a9  2019 All Rights Reserved.",

There is no impact on the consumption of properly cooked poultry products including eggs.To limit the spread of disease, the Government introduced housing measures in November which means that all bird keepers \u2013 whether it is someone who has pet birds or a few chickens, ducks or geese in the back yard to holders of commercial flocks - are legally required to keep them housed and to follow strict biosecurity measures. If strict biosecurity measures are maintained by poultry keepers, the risk of an outbreak of the disease would be low at their premises.Key advice for poultry keepers includes to:House or net all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds;Cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds \u2013 if practical, use disposable protective clothing;Reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control;Thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis;Keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points;Minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds.These housing measures will be kept under regular review.Although the risk to human health from the virus is low, people can catch bird flu via direct contact with a live or dead bird carrying the virus or via direct contact with bird faeces from a bird carrying the virus.",

(WHNT) \u2013 A second case of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) was recently detected in a sample from a white-tailed deer killed in Lauderdale County.According to a news release from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR), CWD is a progressive, fatal disease among white-tailed deer and other deer spieces that results in altered behavior.Animals may carry the disease for years without signs, but as it progresses, the animal may show signs like listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, lack of response, and repetitive walking in a set pattern.After the first case was detected in January, ADCNR designated all of Colbert and Lauderdale counties as CWD Management Zones (CMZ). The areas west of U.S. Highway 43 in Lauderdale to the Mississippi and Tennessee state lines and south of the Tennessee River are a \u201chigh-risk zone,\u201d while the remainder of both counties is considered a buffer zone.Samples were collected from 966 white-tailed deer harvested within the CMZ during the 2021-2022 hunting season. The Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries found one additional positive case while testing the samples.After analyzing the results, ADCNR is suspending the use of supplemental wildlife feeding and baiting privileges within the CMZ. The suspension does not apply to bird feeders within 100 feet of a building or occupied dwelling or feed inside an active feral hog trap.\u201cThe suspension of supplemental feeding and baiting privileges in Lauderdale and Colbert counties is an attempt to slow the spread of CWD in the affected area,\u201d said Chris Blankenship, ADCNR Commissioner. \u201cWe take the presence of this disease very seriously and are utilizing our CWD Strategic Surveillance and Response Plan to manage it. Our staff is prepared, and the Department will do whatever is prudent and reasonable to protect the state\u2019s deer resources and our hunting culture.\u201dSupplemental feeding and baiting privileges are still allowed outside of the CMZ.For more information, visit\u00a0www.outdooralabama.com/cwd-info.Submit\u0394document.getElementById( \"ak_js_1\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() );Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc.

Anyone who has sickness and diarrhoea, or has experienced these symptoms within the last 48 hours, is being asked to please not attend for appointments or to visit.\u201cWe are all well used to taking precautions to minimise the spread of COVID-19 but need to be just as mindful of other infections that can also have serious implications.\u201dThe most effective precaution against norovirus is to wash hands regularly with soap and warm water, and not just rely on hand gel. The symptoms last around two days and the only treatment required is to drink plenty of fluid to stay hydrated. Anyone worried about symptoms, should contact their Pharmacy, GP or NHS 111 online.Compassionate visiting arrangements for certain circumstances have been in place throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and these currently remain in place for those who are visiting:Patients receiving end-of-life care.\nPatients with a mental health issue such as dementia, a learning disability or autism, where a visitor not being present would cause the patient to be distressed and that level of distress could not be managed/supported by the multi-disciplinary team.\nPatients who have an extended hospital stayVisiting for maternity, paediatric/neonatal services and hospice services will follow local guidance.Visiting arrangements are being reviewed regularly.Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust,Manor Hospital, Moat Road,Walsall, West Midlands WS2 9PSSwitchboard: 01922 721172Contact formWalsall Healthcare NHS Trust@WalsallHcareNHS",

  "main_text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: Dee W. Jones, D.V.M., (334) 206-5969Two bats recently found around a personal residence in Clarke County tested positive for rabies. This has caused local and state health authorities to issue a reminder about the potential for bats to transmit rabies. Bats, along with raccoons, are the primary reservoirs for rabies in Alabama. Rabies is a viral infection in mammals that is transmitted by bites, scratches or other contact with infected saliva. Rabies virus is present only in saliva and nervous tissue; it is not transmitted through contact with guano (bat feces), blood or urine from infected animals.Estimates vary, but generally it is estimated that 0.5 to 2 percent of the bat population is positive for rabies. Bats that are not able to fly or that are out during the day have a higher incidence of being positive for rabies. Laboratory testing is the only definitive method for identifying rabies positive bats that may have exposed humans. In 2021, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) reported 13 laboratory-confirmed rabies-positive bats.Although bats can pose a public health risk, they are a very important species to nature. They consume insects, biting pests and pollinate flowers. Dr. Dee W. Jones, State Public Health Veterinarian, says, \u201cProblems arise when bats and humans inhabit the same dwellings. It is common for bats to roost in the rafters and attics of houses, schools or other buildings and occasionally some of the bats can get inside of the living quarters. The age of the building doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate the risk of having a bat roost. We have investigated reports of roosts in newer buildings and sports stadiums on school campuses, as well as older buildings in the community.\u201dAccording to Dr. Jones, the most important step to take following a potential bat exposure is to safely collect it and preserve it for testing. He states, \u201cThe challenge is collecting the bat without further exposing yourself, so gloves should be worn, and a shovel, net or other tool can be used to avoid touching it if possible.\u201dRabies is a fatal disease if left untreated, but is preventable if proper treatment is received soon following the bite or scratch. Anyone exposed to a bat should consult with a medical provider immediately. Vaccination for pets 12 weeks of age and older is required by state law.The ADPH recommends that people should follow the advice of wildlife officials, licensed exterminators and contractors on how to exclude bats from a building. Follow these basic steps to best protect yourself and pets from exposure to bats and rabies:Please refer to alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/rabies.html for more advice about bat infestations and exposures.For more information about rabies risk locally or in Alabama, please contact the Clarke County Health Department (251) 275-3772 or call ADPH at (334) 206-5969.-30-3/7/22County health departments throughout Alabama provide a wide range of confidential and professional services. Contact your local county health department for additional information.Mission: To promote, protect, and improve Alabama\u2019s healthVision: Healthy People. Healthy Communities. Healthy Alabama.",

The child has been discharged from ICU but continues to receive hospital care.NSW Health is concerned about the spread of JEV in the border region and is calling on the community to take care not to be bitten by mosquitoes.JEV is an illness developed in pigs and horses and spread by infected mosquitoes.It can be fatal for humans, however, less than 1 per cent of infected people develop symptoms.The virus has now been detected in four Australian states, an outbreak which has been declared a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance by the Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sonya Bennett.Japanese encephalitis is a rare virus that in serious cases can cause your brain to swell.There is a vaccine but no specific treatment for JEV, which can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.The virus cannot be spread person-to-person or through eating animals.Mosquito control activities are being carried out near farms where pigs are confirmed to have been infected by JEV, and NSW Health is arranging vaccination of workers on affected farms.NSW Health acting chief health officer\u00a0Dr Marianne Gale said the best thing people can do to protect themselves against JEV is to take steps to avoid mosquito bites.\u201cWe are working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and other states and territories to determine the extent to which the virus is circulating,\u201d Dr Gale said.\u201cUnfortunately, our recent wet weather has led to very high mosquito numbers, so we need the community to be particularly vigilant and take steps to avoid mosquito bites.\u201cWe know mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn, and we need people planning activities near waterways or where mosquitoes are present to be especially cautious, particularly those in the vicinity of the Murray River and its branches.\u201dWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",

A case has also been found in Annan.It means that 3km protection and 10km surveillance zones are now in place around the areas where infection has been identified.The zones restrict access to locations where birds are kept and impose restrictions on the movement of birds. They do not limit access to residents, or business owners. The protection and surveillance zones will apply until the zone is withdrawn or amended by DEFRA.With the backdrop of the UK facing its larger ever outbreak of bird flu with over 60 cases confirmed across the country since the start of November 2021, the UK\u2019s Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss is calling on poultry keepers to take action to help stop the spread.To help mitigate the spread of disease, The Government introduced new housing measures last month, which means that if you keep chickens, ducks, geese or any other birds you are now legally required to keep them indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures.If you do not do this, the disease could kill your birds and you may face a fine. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months and other wildlife spread the disease so it is vital not to allow wild birds to mix with your chickens, ducks, geese or other birds.People can also spread the disease on clothing and shoes so, before going into bird enclosures you should wash your hands, and change, or clean and disinfect your footwear.The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency has said that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry or eggs.The Chief Veterinary Officer is reminding all poultry keepers that whilst the main source of infection comes from migratory wild birds, those failing to implement these measures risk infecting their own flocks by walking the virus into their holdings.Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said, \u201cWe have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease including introducing housing measures. However, we are seeing a growing number of bird flu cases both on commercial farms and in backyard birds right across the country.\u201cMany poultry keepers have excellent biosecurity standards, but the number of cases we are seeing suggests that not enough is being done to keep bird flu out. Whether you keep just a few birds, or thousands you must take action now to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.\u201cImplementing scrupulous biosecurity has never been more critical. You must regularly clean and disinfect your footwear and clothes before entering enclosures, stop your birds mixing with any wild birds and only allow visitors that are strictly necessary. It is your actions that will help keep your birds safe.\u201dPoultry and captive bird keepers must be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds and seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns.Keepers are urged to register their flocks with the Animal and Plant Health Agency and Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. This is a legal requirement if you have 50 birds or more.Registering means that they will be able to contact you with information or action required should an outbreak happen near you. Do not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that you find.If you find dead swans, geese or ducks or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. For further information see the\u00a0advice for the public at www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu.Bird keepers should report suspicion of disease in England to Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. In Scotland, contact your local Field Services Office. Keepers should familiarise themselves with the avian flu advice at\u00a0www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu.",

(AP) \u2014 Federal inspectors have confirmed the presence of bird flu in a commercial mixed species flock in southeastern South Dakota.Samples from the flock in Charles Mix County, which borders Nebraska, were tested at a national laboratory at South Dakota State University. The property was quarantined and the birds will be killed to prevent spread of the disease, the Agriculture Department said.Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.The highly contagious virus was discovered a month ago in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana and was detected earlier this week in a backyard flock of chickens and ducks in western Iowa.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.Birds from the South Dakota flock will not enter the food system, the USDA said.",

  "headline": "INDIA - Up Polls - Over 40 Lives Recently Lost To Deadly Malaria - Healthcare Not A Poll Plank In So",
  "main_text": "SUBSCRIBE AND SUPPORTSonbhadra (Uttar Pradesh): Pratibha, 23, entered a wedlock with Ajay Kumar Prajapati, 25, on April 23, 2017. Two children were born to the couple. One is a three-year-old and the other is six months. In August 2021, Pratibha developed fever \u2014 which would often spike despite constant medication. She was expecting her youngest child and was seven months pregnant at that time.She was admitted to a private hospital for 15 days. She tested Pf positive (Plasmodium falciparum \u2014 a parasite, which causes the deadliest form of malaria). The second time her condition deteriorated, she was rushed to the local Hindalco Hospital \u2014 where doctors referred her to the district hospital at Robertsganj (also known as Sonbhadra). She delivered her baby there. Soon after the delivery, she was referred again to Sir Sunderlal Hospital at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU).Twenty-four hours after her admission there, she died on October 3, 2021. Her death certificate noted that she died of CVA (cerebrovascular accident, causing sudden death of some brain cells), postpartum sepsis (which occurs when bacteria infect the uterus and surrounding areas after a woman gives birth) and cardiopulmonary arrest (sudden loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness).Notably, none of her medical records was handed over to her family \u2014 except the death certificate.Pratibha\u2019s mother-in-law, Phoolmati, who cooks midday meals at a local primary school, is now taking care of the toddler.Ajay's mother Phoolmati with her grandson whose mother Pratibha passed away soon after his birth. \u200b\u201cNot only that I lost my life partner who was always with me in all highs and lows, my children lost their mother at such a young age. I did what I could do to save her, but failed. Now, I don\u2019t know how my child will be raised,\u201d Ajay, a resident of Markara village in Myorpur block from Sonbhadra district\u2019s Dudhi tehsil (sub-district), told NewsClick.He is heavily indebted as he spent on her treatment Rs 1.2 lakh, which he has borrowed in three instalments from a private moneylender.His child is so malnourished and underweight that he could not be vaccinated. \u201cI have suggested to his grandmother that they feed her cow\u2019s milk, but they are unable to do it for two reasons: their financial condition and cow milk is deficient in this area,\u201d said Parwati, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) stationed at Makara Public Health Centre (PHC).Ajay\u2019s suffering did not end here. Fifteen days after his wife Pratibha\u2019s death, his 14-month-old niece (sister\u2019s daughter), Sarita, breathed her last on September 18, 2021. She too was found positive for the fatal Pf. After her fever shot up, she was taken to a hospital. She died on the way.Sarita was said to have contracted the infection from her lactating mother, Kusum, 23, who was also tested positive for malaria parasite. When her daughter died, she was admitted to a private hospital at Robertsganj and given five units of platelets and two units of blood.The mother of a three-year-old son, she had earlier lost a 14-month baby to the disease.The dangerous disease has been wreaking havoc in at least six hamlets (Makara, Gadha, Bijul Jhariya, Aghariyah Didh Bodhrahwan, Ban Paisa) of Sindur Makara and Pati gram panchayats (village-governing bodies) in Sonbhadra\u2019s Myorpur block close, to the industrial town of Renukoot.At least 40 deaths have been reported in the last two months in these hamlets, which together have a population of around 6,000 people.Gond tribe, which is listed among the Scheduled Tribes (ST), makes up the bulk of the population here. According to the Census 2011, Sonbhadra\u2019s population is made up of around 23% Scheduled Castes and 21% Scheduled Tribes.The villages are also inhabited by Other Backward Castes (OBC) such as Prajapati and Patel whose condition is no better.The recent deaths and the saga of helplessness, however, have failed to shake the conscience of the government. The local administration or the government have not developed any infrastructure or additional facilities to ensure that the endemic does not return.Close to Ajay\u2019s house lives 47-year-old Amravati and 65-year-old Manghi in a thatched, dilapidated house made of clay, straw and reeds. Both daughter- and mother-in-law duo lost their husbands to the disease. The family is now left with no male members \u2013 on whom the two women typically relied on for their livelihood.Amravati's husband, Ram Pyare (48) died on August 15, 2021. He was sick with fever and abdominal pain. After his body temperature and the pain did not subside despite medication, he was taken to the Sonbhadra\u2019s district hospital where he was admitted and underwent treatment for a week. Even after several medical examinations, doctors were clueless about the disease.He was referred to the BHU\u2019s medical college and hospital in Varanasi. But before he could be shifted, he breathed his last. He was reported to have been suffering from typhoid and malaria coinfection.Five days after Pyare\u2019s death, his father, Ram Baran (70), too, died of malaria on August 20 last year after suffering from fever for two days. Because of the abject poverty and finances already drained due to the son\u2019s medical treatment, Ram Baran could not be taken to any hospital.Amravati (L) with her mother-in-law Manghi (R). Both lost their husbands to malaria.Now, Amravati has to sustain her only minor son and the ailing mother-in-law, who is unable to walk properly. \u201cNaa puchin saahib ki pariwar kaise chalat hai (don\u2019t ask us how we are surviving),\u201d said the visibly upset woman who hardly gets any work to earn livelihood.It is the people around her who keep extending financial help to keep the family running. \u201cWe only get free ration from the government and nothing else. There are no old age and widow pensions,\u201d she added.Residents from these six hamlets told NewsClick that a majority of them (about 90%, claimed some) are deprived of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY), under which a sum of Rs 1.30 lakh is given to people in rural areas for construction of a pucca house. They have no reliable source of employment. They are allotted work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREGA) Act, 2005, \u201conce in a blue moon\u201d, but don\u2019t get payment for months together or even for as long as a year.The villages have only one PHC at Makara where no doctor was available when NewsClick visited during the working hours. Two employees and an ANM (Parwati) were present at the health centre who said that the \u201cdoctor saheb has just left\u201d.One of the officials, refusing to be named, said that the PHC caters to a large area only, but only one MBBS doctor is deputed here.The state is facing a shortfall of 2,277 doctors. Its 942 primary health centres (PHCs) continue to operate without electricity, regular water supply and all-weather motorable approach road. The PHCs in the state have the worst patient-to-doctor ratio and infrastructure in the country to cater to the poorest patients.Around two kilometres from Makara lies Gadha village where Uday Raj Gaud, 70, died 10 months back \u2013 just three days after he developed fever. He also had tested positive for malaria parasite.\u201cThe election of pradhans (village heads) was going on, and he was actively engaged in campaigning. One day, after he returned from the poll canvassing in the area, he complained of fever, breathlessness, and seizure. We rushed him to Hindalco Hospital where doctors refused to admit him. We did not have resources to take him to either a private hospital or district hospital, which is around 50 kilometres away from here; and therefore, we consulted quacks who also refused to treat him given his serious condition. He breathed his last as we were planning to rush him to the BHU\u2019s medical college,\u201d narrated Kalpa.Not even two months had passed when Uday\u2019s 30-year-old son, Ram Charan \u2014 a father of four minors \u2014 died of malaria. He was unwell for one month. \u201cHe had become so weak that he had stopped all movement a few days before his death,\u201d said his family members.The family has 1.5 bigha (0.92 acre) of land between two brothers.The people in these villages have very small landholdings. Because of being a water-deficient region, they depend mainly on rainfall. Due to low levels of groundwater (at a depth of 200-250 feet), irrigation using wells is not feasible. Pumping water from such a depth is expensive as well and not affordable to most of the residents here.Mainly chana (gram), arhar (pigeon pea), masoor (lentil), mustard, onion, and wheat are grown here for household uses. The residents here don\u2019t do agricultural farming for commercial purposes as yield is too low in the water-starved region.Of the total 250 pucca houses in the two panchayats, with around 5,000 residences, 100 have been constructed recently under the PMAY. The remaining 150 houses were constructed under the Indira Awas Yojna.When the malaria deaths made the headlines in November last year, the district administration seemed to have woken up from its slumber. All high-ranking officials visited the affected villages. But months later, nothing seems to have been done to prevent the tragedy in future.BJP MLA and minister Sanjeev Kumar Gond, who represents Obra (reserved) constituency (under which these hamlets fall), too had reached the villages and cited contaminated drinking water as the reason for the deaths.Villagers were supplied drinking water through water tankers for some time. They were promised that water treatment plants would be set up in the villages, but nothing has happened so far. Even the temporary water supply has been stopped. The villagers are once again drinking the same \u201ccontaminated\u201d water they get from the open wells in the region.Gond, the minister for social welfare in the state government, had also promised that the deceased people\u2019s families would receive some compensation, but it turned out to be a lip service.Talking about the prevailing situation in the affected villages, Sonbhadra\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr Nem Singh claimed, \u201cWe are continuously running awareness campaigns. Malaria deaths have come down significantly. The officials who were found guilty of negligence have been removed from the areas, and show cause notices have been served to them.\u201dHe said that the Health Department is carrying out continuous fogging in the affected areas.\u201cWater samples have also been taken. Every single death in these areas is being audited. We cannot force anyone to get medical treatments only from government hospitals, but we are constantly making people aware of the good and free treatment government hospitals provide,\u201d he said.The villagers contradicted the claims, saying that the fogging had been done only once in November last year. They also showed details of the fogging written on the walls of most of the houses.Unfortunately, this is not an issue in the ongoing elections. Representatives belonging to different political parties are reaching out to the villagers and giving them assurances. Though the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\u2019s flags unfurling atop almost every house in the villages is a common sight here, voters don\u2019t seem to vovalise their support to the ruling party.OBRA CONSTITUENCY AT A GLANCEObra is one of the 403 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly constituencies, which falls under the Sonbhadra district. The election will be held here on March 7 in the final phase.In 2017, the Obra Assembly seat had 3,07,992 registered voters. Of them, 1,69,473 were male and 1,38,519 were female voters. 1.4% of the votes were casted for NOTA.In 2017, 11 candidates were competing for the Obra Assembly constituency seat. Obra was one of 312 seats won by the BJP. It was a one-way contest with BJP\u2019s Sanjiv Kumar comfortably winning the election, defeating Samajwadi Party\u2019s Ravi Gond by a huge margin of 44,269 votes.The top three candidates split 88.9% of the votes among them. The BJP got a total of 78,058 votes, while the SP secured 33,789 votes. Bahujan Samaj Party\u2019s candidate Virendra Pratap Singh grabbed the third spot with 29,113 votes. The top three parties got 49.2%, 21.3% and 18.4% of the votes respectively.Bahujan Samaj Party\u2019s Sunil Kumar had defeated BJP\u2019s Devendra Prasad Shastri by 7,060 votes in the 2012 elections.This time, the BJP and the SP are engaged in an intense face-off, with observers unable to make strong predictions.Subscribe and Support",

This brings the total in Andalucia to 22 cases.The Ministry of Agriculture announced today, Saturday, March 5, that these two latest discoveries have been uncovered on turkey farms in the municipalities of Estepa and El Rubio, both inside the restricted area laid out after \u200b\u200bthe previous reported outbreaks.Of the 22 poultry farms affected in Andalucia, six are in the province of Huelva, and the rest are in Sevilla. The farm in El Rubio has around 10,000 turkeys with a mortality rate of about 80 per cent, while in Estapa, the farm has approximately 24,000 birds, with almost 90 per cent mortality.Following the established procedure, the Veterinary Services of the Junta de Andalucia immediately sent the first birds showing symptoms compatible with the disease, and an increase in mortality, to the Central Laboratory in Algete. This is the National Reference Laboratory for avian influenza.According to the source, once again, it is a strain of the H5N1 subtype, the same one that has appeared in recent months in different parts of the European continent.There is no evidence that H5N1 can be passed to humans, although it is recommended not to expose oneself to birds that show symptoms compatible with bird flu, or are found dead outdoors.There are an estimated 5 million birds on about 600 farms within the current restriction zones. To facilitate the movement of birds from within these areas the Ministry of Agriculture has established a channelled exit procedure to the slaughterhouse, which is being carried out in coordination with the Health authorities.Andalucia\u2019s official veterinary services are putting into measures into practice that are necessary to control the active foci of this avian influenza, while establishing the corresponding surveillance and protection tasks. It is also working on the prevention of the spread of the disease in Andalucia, as reported by laopiniondemalaga.es.___________________________________________________________Thank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check\u00a0The Euro Weekly News\u00a0website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.Share this storySubscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don\u2019t already have one.

A further six bird carcasses from the park were handed in this week and staff believe the same strain of flu is to blame.\"The risk to public health is very low but as a precautionary measure the Council is asking all members of the public not to hand-feed birds at any of its parks or country parks.\"\"If you find a dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Animal Plant and Health Agency (APHA) on 03459 33 55 77. Any visibly sick birds should also be reported via this number and must not be touched or handled.\"To get the latest newsletters from CardiffOnline click here.37 fascinating pictures of Cardiff's Roath that will take you back",

A sanitary inspector conducts a search-and-destroy operation against breeding sites of mosquitoes Friday (March 4, 2022) in Barangay San Roque, Zamboanga City as dengue cases soar to 338 with nine deaths since January. The city health office reminded residents to always protect themselves from dengue through the 4S strategy. (Photo courtesy of Zamboanga CIO)ZAMBOANGA CITY \u2013 The city health office on Friday reminded residents to practice the four \u201cS\u201d strategy against dengue, an acute viral infection that affects mostly children and infants, following a continuing increase in the number of cases here.Dr. Dulce Amor Miravite, city health officer, issued the reminder as dengue cases in the city reached the 338 mark with nine mortalities since January this year.The four \u201cS\u201d campaign stands for: Search and destroy mosquito-breeding sites; secure Self-protection measures like wearing long pants and long-sleeve shirts and daily use of mosquito repellent; Seek early consultation; and, Support fogging or spraying only in hotspot areas where an increase in cases is registered for two consecutive weeks to prevent an impending outbreak.\u201cAs we can see, we are experiencing rain at night, so we have to destroy the breeding sites of mosquitoes,\u201d Miravite said.She said the dengue fatalities came from the barangays of Bolong, Mercedes, Tictapul, Camino Nuevo, Tetuan, Sinunuc, Buenavista and Sta. Catalina.She noted that six of the city\u2019s 98 barangays have a high number of dengue cases reported from January.The six barangays and their respective dengue cases are as follows: Mercedes, 15; Culianan, nine; Divisoria, nine; Zambowood, nine; Lanzones, three; and, Quiniput, three.Dengue virus is spread to people through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.The mosquito can be recognized by white markings on its legs and a pattern in the form of a lyre on the upper surface of its thorax.The most common symptoms of dengue fever are nausea, vomiting, rashes, aches, and pain such as eye pain, typically behind the eyes, muscle, joint, or bone pain.

  "main_text": "PIGGERIES IMPACTED: SunPork Group managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld says several of their piggeries have been impacted by JEV. Dr van Barneveld is pictured here speaking at Swickers' boning facility reopening at Kingaroy in 2018. Photo: Martin BunyardAustralia's biggest pork producer has confirmed several of its piggeries have been impacted by Japanese encephalitis virus.Australia's biggest pork producer SunPork has confirmed its piggeries have been impacted by Japanese encephalitis virus.JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals - mostly pigs and horses.SunPork Group CEO and managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld said several of their sites in the eastern states had been impacted and they were working through it.\"One of the Goondiwindi farms has been infected ... we have an infected premises in New South Wales ... There are infected premises all down the east coast,\" Dr van Barneveld said.\"We've been working on this endlessly since Friday night when we first were made aware that it was an issue.\"Dr van Barneveld said it was not a new occurrence and there was no cause for alarm in the pork industry.\"The piggeries are innocent bystanders. Pigs are not going to infect other pigs. It's not going to have a negative effect at an abattoir. The pork is safe to eat. It's play on,\" he said.\"If you're going to have an emergency animal disease, this is the one to have. We're not actually anticipating any significant disruption to our operations at all.\"Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.Humans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.\"If a mosquito bites people and if it bites horses, they're called dead end hosts, so it doesn't pass on. If it bites a pig - a pig's an amplifier - so if another mosquito bites that pig while it's viremic, which is a very short period of time, it can transmit in the mosquito population,\" Dr van Barneveld said.\"That's why there are controls around the movement of pigs.\"Dr van Barneveld said authorities were working well together to protect humans and animals.\"This is about protecting people and the bad guy in the process is a mosquito and the weather patterns,\" he said.\"The state health departments and the state chief veterinary officers have worked extremely well together. They understand that eradicating it is going to be very unlikely and they're being very practical around the movement of pigs and making sure people are safe.\"He said SunPork had done a lot of preparedness work around African Swine Fever and had good relationships with the state chief veterinary officers which puts it in a very good position to manage this.\"When you get a disease like this, there are a whole stack of legislative instruments that are pushed into place that have to be executed, and they're following those processes.\"Everyone's fairly calm about it and think we can manage through it with minimal disruption.\"A vaccine for horses and pigs is available in countries where the disease is endemic, but no JE vaccines for animals are registered for use in Australia, and there is no effective treatment for JE in animals.On Friday, Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria.This follows a confirmed human case of JEV in Queensland. Queensland Health said the confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.Less than 1 per cent of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.Goondiwindi and District Veterinary Services owner and vet Dr Trisha Pullos said the recent heavy rain in parts of Queensland and NSW had brought with it more mosquitoes and potentially more risk of JEV.\"We've had quite a bit of rain like everybody else, and the mozzies out here are brutal,\" Dr Pullos said.Dr Pullos said the main issues were observed in piglets - pigs didn't seem to be affected physically.\"If the piglets are born dead or weak or malformed or something really unusual or if the sow aborts the whole litter - that's the first sign,\" she said.\"Pigs can amplify the virus. It's not transferable between humans; it seems to be just the mosquitoes that are how we can catch it, so if you can keep the mozzies off you, then we'll be a little bit safer.\"She said it was important to get information from reliable sources and anyone who was worried should contact their vet.\"Anybody who's got two pigs in the backyard, or a pig for the kids, or a little kill herd at the back of the property - they need to contact their local vet and just say, 'Hey, I've got two pigs here. What do I need to keep an eye out for?'\"Then what we'll do is we'll let our district vet know who will then let the Chief Veterinary Officer know so we can try and track it a lot faster, because if someone goes and tells their neighbour but doesn't tell the vet then we're already behind the eight ball.\"She said there was a risk people had 'bad news fatigue' and wouldn't take things seriously.\"I've found that everyone's a little bit worn out. There's been quite a few comments on our Facebook posts where people are just like, 'Not again', or 'What now?' 'Can it just end?\"We might be at risk of going, 'Oh, whatever', and I want to make sure that they're not going to do that.\"JEV was detected in three people in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995. In 1998, two further cases were detected in people in Queensland, including one acquired on the Australian mainland.JEV is mostly transmitted by bites from infected mosquito vectors and is maintained in mosquito-waterbird or mosquito-waterbird-pig cycles.Waterbirds, particularly wading birds such as herons and egrets, are the main source from which transmission of JEV can occur. They are important amplifying hosts and hold enough virus in their blood to infect vectors for one to seven days.Pigs are also major amplifiers of the virus and develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect vectors for around four days.Horses and a wide range of other species may be infected but do not develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect mosquitoes, so are not involved in maintaining disease in an area.More newsWant daily news highlights delivered to your inbox?

Following on from this, we will shortly be introducing compulsory biosecurity measures relating to poultry and kept birds on the whole Island.\u2018Private birdkeepers should do everything possible at this time to ensure their flocks avoid contact with wild birds.

  "main_text": "by\n             Molly Walker, Deputy Managing Editor, MedPage Today                        \n        March 4, 2022Two service workers in Washington, D.C. contracted Seoul hantavirus in what is believed to be the first locally transmitted cases of the virus on U.S. soil.Both patients presented with several days of chills, high fever, headache, diarrhea, and vomiting. Both had acute kidney injury and responded to supportive treatment, and were later discharged.Rats seem to be the culprit in both cases, as Washington, D.C. has experienced increased calls to rodent control centers due to overpopulation, and Seoul hantavirus can be transmitted through aerosol exposure from rodent feces, saliva, or urine, noted Nivedita Ravi-Caldwell, DVM, of the CDC, and colleagues in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.They said that the first patient developed the first case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, \"a potentially fatal systemic inflammatory syndrome,\" related to hantavirus infection in the U.S., and only the second worldwide. The first was documented in China.\"Although extremely rare, the two ... cases ... highlight the importance of physicians including hantavirus infection in their differential diagnoses in patients with compatible symptoms and history of animal exposure or travel and underscore the importance of reporting notifiable infectious disease cases to health departments for investigation and response,\" the researchers wrote.The first patient, a 30-year-old man who worked in maintenance, presented in May 2018 to a Washington, D.C. healthcare facility with a 4-day history of symptoms, despite taking antipyretic medication. In addition to acute kidney injury over several days, he experienced hemoconcentration and thrombocytopenia. A week later, he had \"signs consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,\" including elevated levels of ferritin, triglycerides, and interleukin-2, as well as hemophagocytosis cells on a bone marrow biopsy.The second patient, a 37-year-old man who worked as a dishwasher and plumber's assistant, presented in November 2018 to a Washington, D.C. emergency department with a 3-day history of symptoms, including myalgia and productive cough. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of hepatic transaminases.Both patients had serology testing sent to CDC, showing hantavirus IgG and IgM titers that confirmed recent infection. Interestingly, Ravi-Caldwell's group noted that while the first patient had \"frequent rodent sightings\" at his workplace, the second was \"unaware of exposure to rodents at work, at home, or during his commute.\"The researchers explained that Norway rats can serve as reservoirs for Seoul hantavirus in the U.S., and \"previous cases of hantavirus infection have been linked to wild or pet rodents.\"Molly Walker is deputy managing editor and covers infectious diseases for MedPage Today.

  "headline": "RHODE ISLAND - Super-Contagious Avian Flu Seen As Threat To Rhode Island Poultry",
  "main_text": "PROVIDENCE \u2014 State environmental authorities are warning of a strain of flu lethal to poultry\u00a0that is expected to hit Rhode Island soon,\u00a0if it\u2019s not here already.No human cases of this type of avian influenza have been found in the United States, and it is not seen as a threat to people or to public health, but the virus is\u00a0deadly to chickens, ducks, turkeys and other farmed\u00a0and wild birds.\u201cIt is absolutely a concern\u00a0for all our membership,\u201d said Heidi Quinn, executive director of the Rhode Island Farm Bureau.\u00a0\u201cFrom our smallest to our biggest farms, it would affect them all. They have the potential to lose all their birds.\u201dThe virus\u00a0was first detected in South Carolina on Jan. 14 and in subsequent weeks has spread to the Midwest and the Northeast. Over the past three days, infected birds have been found in Connecticut and Massachusetts.More:Flu season arrives early in Rhode Island. Why and what to doThe virus has also been detected in wild waterfowl harvested by hunters along the Atlantic flyway, the migratory bird path that passes through Rhode Island.The last major outbreak of avian flu in the United States was in 2015, but Rhode Island state veterinarian Scott Marshall said the current occurrence of the virus is more worrying because of its geographic range.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine that we have the virus in the state,\u201d he said.Because mortality rates in infected flocks can be close to 100%, he and other officials with the state Department of Environmental Management\u00a0are monitoring poultry farms and urging owners to take steps to prevent infection.They include restricting access to farmed birds; ensuring they\u2019re kept away from wild birds, particularly migratory waterfowl; disinfecting cages, coops and clothes; not sharing equipment with other poultry producers; properly disposing of dead birds; and reporting sick birds or unusual bird deaths to the DEM.More:Special Good Night Lights tonight for military medical team that helped RI fight COVIDIf infected birds are found, they must be humanely killed to limit the spread of the virus, officials said. If no action is taken, all poultry across the state could be wiped out, they warned. Farmers would be eligible for federal relief if they have birds that must be killed.The DEM is reaching out to poultry farmers. The agency is\u00a0also working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to monitor for the virus, and with the state Department of Health and state Emergency Management Agency on emergency response plans.Under those plans, the DEM would respond quickly to reports of sick or dying poultry and obtain samples to be tested at nationally accredited labs. If a diagnosis is confirmed, the poultry on the affected farm will be killed within 24 hours. A control zone may also be established around the farm.Poultry owners across the region are being asked to voluntarily postpone through June any shows, exhibitions or\u00a0swap meets where birds are traded.They are also being asked to watch for signs of the disease in their birds, such as diarrhea, respiratory difficulty or neurological issues. Sudden death and in larger flocks, increased mortality rates, are of particular concern.\u201cThat should be a red flag and impetus for them to call us so we can go out and test,\u201d Marshall said.Members of the public wishing to\u00a0report sick or dying domestic birds should call (401) 222-2781.\u00a0If they fail to reach someone or if it\u2019s after regular business hours, call (401)\u00a0222-3070.\u00a0To report sick or dying wild birds, the number is (401) 789-0281.Although there is a risk for all poultry producers, it is lower for the biggest farmers in the state, such as Baffoni\u2019s Poultry Farm in Johnston or Little Rhody Farms in Johnston, which sells eggs, because they keep their birds under cover, said Quinn. For owners who keep their birds outdoors in mobile \u201cchicken tractors\u201d or backyard coops, the chances of interactions with infected wild birds are higher.Quinn said the most important thing is to get the word out so that poultry owners take steps to protect their flocks from the virus.\u201cEvery time it comes up, the hair stands up on the back of our necks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's super-contagious.\u201d",

Owners are being told to monitor their birds for symptoms of avian influenza and by implementing biosecurity practices.Highly pathogenic avian influenza is an very contagious viral disease that can infect turkeys, chickens and other birds, causing severe illness and/or sudden death. HPAI has been found in backyard flocks as well as commercial operations in neighboring states but it has not been detected in the state of Kansas as of yet.\u201cProtecting the poultry in the state is a high priority, and we need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent the spread of disease in Kansas,\u201d Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said. \u201cOur best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness.\u201dTo best protect your poultry using biosecurity methods to prevent contamination, the KDA recommends:Symptoms of HPAI can include: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite\u2019 decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also bring about sudden death in birds even if they aren\u2019t showing other symptoms.If you see these symptoms in your birds, the KDA recommends that you reach out to your veterinarian immediately. Contact the KDA at 785-564-6601 if you don\u2019t have access to a veterinarian.The recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern according to the Centers for Disease Control. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been found in the U.S. Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk: poultry and eggs are safe for consumption when handled and cooked properly.According to the CDC, bird influenza rarely affects people. Humans can become infected when a bird sheds the virus in its saliva, mucous and/or feces. Humans are often infected when the virus gets into a person\u2019s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. When human infections are reported, the infections is usually limited, inefficient and not sustained.Federal and state partners are working together on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock as part of existing avian influenza response plans. The U.S. has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world according to the KDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.For more information on HPAI, go to the KDA\u2019s avian influenza webpage here or call 785-564-6601.Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc.

  "headline": "MISSOURI - Missouri - 240000 Broilers In Avian Flu-Infected Flock",
  "main_text": "There were 240,000 chickens in the Stoddard County broiler flock where the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was confirmed, according to information released by the Missouri Department of Agriculture (MDA).During the morning of March 4, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced that HPAI had been confirmed in commercial broiler flock in Stoddard County, Missouri, but the agency did not reveal the size of the flock.Several hours later, MDA, on its website, stated the number of chickens affected, but offered little additional information not already provided by APHIS.The farm has been quarantined and depopulation activities are underway.This case is the second case of HPAI in commercial broilers in the United States in 2022.Stoddard County, in southeastern Missouri, is in relative close proximity to Fulton County, Kentucky, where the country\u2019s first confirmed case of HPAI in a commercial broiler flock occurred. The Fulton County case involved 246,000 chickens.Kentucky, to date has had two cases of HPAI. The other case involved a commercial turkey flock in Webster County. Other confirmed cases of HPAI in the United States include four commercial turkey flocks in Dubois County, Indiana, two commercial turkey flocks in Greene County, Indiana, and a commercial layer flock in New Castle County, Delaware.The presence of HPAI in a commercial turkey flock in Nova Scotia, Canada, was also confirmed earlier in 2022.To date, HPAI has been confirmed in three of the four flyways.

(WIS) - The Dept. of Health and Environmental Control has asked that residents submit certain types of dead birds to help track West Nile Virus.During the spring, summer and fall, DHEC is asking that residents submit recently deceased crows, blue jays, house finches and house sparrows that appear to not have been injured and are not decayed.Officials say those birds are more susceptible to WNV than other species, which makes them good candidates for testing. Other birds will be tested on a case-by-case basis.DHEC\u2019s goal with the dead bird surveillance program is to better understand where and when there is an increase in West Nile virus activity. The activity is reported to local mosquito control programs, so they can take action to protect the health of local residents.The birds can be submitted to DHEC at local Environmental Affairs offices from March 15 through November 30.Here are DHEC officials\u2019 tips on how to collect dead birds:\u201cThe public\u2019s involvement with dead bird surveillance helps identify West Nile virus before it shows up in people,\u201d said Dr. Chris Evans, State Public Health Entomologist. \u201cThis is a unique opportunity for the public to proactively assist their public health agency in staying ahead of a potential health risk.\u201dFor more information, click here or call 803-896-3802.Copyright 2022 WIS.

Our message is if you have ever dabbled with drugs (even when you were much younger), practiced unsafe sex or had a tattoo while travelling abroad please get yourself tested just to make sure \u2013 the virus has no symptoms in the early stages.\u201cJust as importantly, if we are to meet the World Health Organisations target of elimination by 2030, we\u00a0need urgent action to tackle the drug problem in the UK so that new people do not become infected.\u201dModelling indicates that, of the 81,000 people estimated to have this chronic infection in England, around:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a bloodborne virus that can cause life-threatening liver disease, including cancer. \u00a0However, those infected often have no symptoms until many years later when their liver has been badly damaged. \u00a0When symptoms do occur, they can often be non-specific, like tiredness or loss of appetite, and be dismissed or mistaken for other conditions.Andrew, 47 years old, a former hepatitis C patient based in Scotland: \u201cI was surprised to learn that I had hepatitis C.\u00a0 I got tested a couple of times before and was negative. I learned about it by chance.\u00a0 I was in the hospital on an unrelated matter and got blood taken, and my liver results were a bit abnormal.\u00a0 I got my drugs worker to test me and I found out that I was positive for hepatitis C.\u00a0 I was devastated.\u00a0 I even thought that I was going to die.\u00a0 Luckily, the modern treatment is superb.\u201cI started my course of tablets immediately after learning that I\u2019d got hepatitis C, and when I got tested again in 12 weeks, to my relief, I\u2019d been cured.\u00a0 To anyone in a similar situation, get tested. Do it to get that piece of mind for yourself.\u201dDr Helen Harris, Clinical Scientist at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \u201cIn England, we are on our way to eliminating hepatitis C as the number of deaths continue to decline, and direct acting antiviral drugs are available that will clear the virus in around 95% of people who complete treatment.\u201cBut many people remain undiagnosed, often because they have no symptoms or are unaware that they have ever been at risk. \u00a0If you have ever injected drugs \u2013 even if it happened only once or years ago \u2013 you could be at risk of hepatitis C. \u00a0If you think you could be at risk, speak to your GP and get a free test.\u201dRead the full report here:\u00a0https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-c-in-the-ukYou can also find out if you are at risk by taking online quiz -\u00a0 visit www.britishlivertrust.org.uk/screener.\u201dTweets by LiverTrustBritish Liver Trust\nVenta Court\n20 Jewry Street\nWinchester\nSO23 8FEThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

  "headline": "AUSTRALIA - Rare Mosquito-Borne Japanese Virus Detected In Queensland",
  "main_text": "An urgent public health alert has been issued after the first human case of a serious mosquito-borne virus was detected in Queensland.A public health alert has been issued following the first confirmed human case of a rare mosquito-borne virus in Queensland.The person recently travelled throughout southern Queensland and is being treated in a Brisbane hospital.The Japanese Encephalitis Virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals.In animals, it mostly occurs in pigs and horses.Clinicians at Queensland hospitals have been urged to watch out for the virus in people presenting with brain swelling or similar symptoms.Most human infections cause no symptoms or mild ones such as headache or fever.But a person with severe disease may present with inflammation of the brain, characterised by sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and chills, severe headache, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness and nausea or vomiting.Children aged under five and older people are at a higher risk of developing more severe illness.\u201cWe encourage Queenslanders to take necessary steps to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes, especially given the recent flooding event which may lead to an increase in mosquito numbers in coming weeks,\u201d Queensland Health said in a statement on Thursday night.The human case follows a detection at a piggery in southern Queensland last week.There have also been detections in NSW, Victoria and South Australia.\u201cThere is no risk to humans from consuming pork or pig products. Pork products are safe to eat,\u201d Queensland Health said.\u201cThe virus cannot be spread directly from person to person.\u201dQueensland Health is working with the Department of Agriculture as well as state, territory and federal agencies to discuss a national response.Support is also being provided to intensive livestock industry workers.Further south, NSW officials are responding to an outbreak in animals of the mosquito-borne disease, which has never been seen in southern Australia before.Officials realised last week Japanese Encephalitis was spreading in piggeries in the state\u2019s south after agriculture businesses noticed an increase in stillborn piglets.The disease has been detected in six piggeries in NSW, one in Victoria and one in Queensland.Four human cases have been detected in Victoria.People have been warned to avoid being bit by mosquitoes and there are concerns the insects will spike in numbers due to the ongoing flooding crisis.NSW health secretary Elizabeth Koff told a budget estimates hearing on Thursday officials were focused on preventing Japanese encephalitis from spreading to people.Though most people who get infected experience no symptoms, children are vulnerable and on rare occasions get seriously ill.Symptoms include fever, joint pain and rashes and in severe cases patients have suffered from neurological illness with headaches, convulsions and loss of consciousness.\u201cIt\u2019s most concerning in the under-five age group,\u201d Ms Koff said.She added NSW had secured \u201cplentiful supplies\u201d of vaccines that can protect against the disease.In a warning issued last weekend, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said people should take care to protect themselves against mosquito bites.\u201cIt is really important to protect yourself from mosquito bites as mosquitoes can spread viruses including Japanese encephalitis,\u201d she said.The current Japanese encephalitis outbreak is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, according to Australian Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp.\u201cBiosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure,\u201d he said earlier in the week.The wet summer has provided good breeding conditions for mosquitoes and stagnant pools of water left by the ongoing floods on the east coast could lead to an even bigger increase.\u201cMosquitoes carry multiple and potentially dangerous illnesses, and people in rain-affected areas are particularly vulnerable right now given these conditions are ripe for mosquito activity,\u201d Queensland Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said earlier in the week.\u201cSome of the most common mosquito-borne illnesses are Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus and malaria, though these are only some of what can be spread by a mosquito bite.\u201cVictorians who work in casual or other insecure jobs will no longer be forced to choose between a day\u2019s pay and looking after their health.The sudden passing of Shane Warne at just 52 from a suspected heart attack has given Aussie men the nudge to take their own health seriously.Long weekend holiday-makers are being urged to protect themselves as the Japanese encephalitis outbreak grows.Our Apps",

  "headline": "GEORGIA - Rare Tropical Disease Linked To Aromatherapy Spray Killed 2",
  "main_text": "ATLANTA, GA \u2014 A 5-year-old boy in Georgia and a 53-year-old woman in Kansas died from a rare tropical disease \u2014 typically found in South Asia \u2014 that was linked to an imported aromatherapy spray product sold at Walmart stores.That's according to new details published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, which outlined four cases of melioidosis in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and Texas, that were linked to bottles of room sprays from Better Homes and Gardens. The bottles were labeled as a \"highly fragranced essential oil and semi-precious stone infused room spray\" with a \"lavender and chamomile\" scent.And now, the authors say health care professionals should more closely consider melioidosis in patients showing similar symptoms, even if they haven't traveled to places where the disease is endemic.As Patch previously reported, Walmart recalled about 3,900 bottles of \"Better Homes and Gardens Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones.\" The aromatherapy room spray was sold at 55 Walmart stores and online from February 2021 through October 2021 for about $4.One bottle of the essential oil sprays was found to contain Burkholderia pseudomallei, a dangerous bacteria that lives in soil and water and causes the melioidosis infection when ingested, breathed or absorbed through the skin.The infection, also called Whitmore's disease, can lead to skin abscesses in the absence of fever, pneumonia, sepsis, organ abscesses, genital infection, and inflamed brain or spinal cord.Most melioidosis cases are reported in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Northern Australia, as well as several other South Asia countries, though there have been cases reported in Puerto Rico, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Central and South America, and parts of Africa and the Middle East, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But in America, cases are exceedingly rare. About a dozen are reported to the CDC each year, and the vast majority are linked to travel to areas where melioidosis is endemic. So experts were puzzled when two people in America died from the bacteria, and none of the four in the cluster of cases \u2014 which occurred over a period of just a few months \u2014 had traveled internationally.After testing numerous items the four patients were exposed to, researchers connected the strain of bacteria to an aromatherapy spray bottle that was imported from India.All four patients were hospitalized early during their clinical course, the researchers said.Initial tests did not reveal a bacterial infection.Kansas CaseIn the first case, a 53-year-old woman went to an emergency room March 13 in Kansas. The woman fell ill with shortness of breath, cough, malaise and weakness. She also had an extensive past of medical issues, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, cirrhosis due to hepatitis C, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, psoriatic arthritis and drug and alcohol abuse.She was given antibiotics for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection, the researchers said, as steroids for the COPD. But her condition deteriorated to the point where she was moved to an intensive care unit on day four and given a wider array of antibiotics. Two days later, she developed septic shock and had to be placed on a ventilator. She died on her ninth day in the hospital. A post-death examination was not performed, the researchers said.Texas CaseTwo months later, a 4-year-old girl in Texas fell ill.She visited a doctor May 31 after three days with a fever, decreased activity, loss of appetite and a day of vomiting.The girl had no significant medical history and hadn't traveled out of the country. After an unremarkable exam, she was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis.Two days later, she was taken to an urgent care clinic because the fever continued, now at 103 degrees. She was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection after a test of her urine, and was sent home with a penicillin-type antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.The girl's condition initially improved, but she returned to the emergency department two days later with intermittent fevers, vomiting and progressive lethargy. She had a fever of nearly 101 degrees and was tachycardic and tachypneic, meaning her heart was beating abnormally fast and her breathing was atypically rapid. Additionally, her white-cell count was 16,000 per cubic millimeter, lower than the 17,7000 she had just two days earlier.The girl tested positive for human rhinovirus and enterovirus, and she was admitted into a children's ICU. She was diagnosed with septic shock and meningoencephalitis, or serious inflammation of the brain and membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord.She received ceftriaxone, an anti-bacterial medication, and had to be intubated due to falling blood-oxygen levels. She was also given anti-inflammatory drugs. But her breathing and neurologic conditions continued to decline while in the ICU, and she had to receive broader antibiotics. She was eventually diagnosed with melioidosis after a blood culture grew the bacteria, which was initially misidentified. She received drug treatments for eight weeks, followed by months of eradication therapy.\"Three months after discharge, the patient remained wheelchair-bound and nonverbal,\" the researchers saidAlso in late May, a 53-year-old man was rushed to a Minnesota emergency room after family members found him weak and in an altered mental state.The man had a history of medical issues, including a dependence on alcohol and tobacco. He, too, hadn't traveled internationally.An MRI of his brain showed his condition was consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. The neurological disease is often characterized by confusion, an inability to coordinate voluntary movement and eye abnormalities. He was admitted to a hospital for treatment of acute metabolic encephalopathy. The man experienced hip pain while in the hospital, and additional MRI images showed some degeneration changes.After six days in the hospital, he was discharged to a transitional care facility.But on June 6, just eight days after his initial emergency room visit, the man was moved back to the ER with a 104-degree fever and deteriorating mental state. His oxygen saturation had fallen to 90 percent.He was given medication after chest scans showed evidence of pneumonia. Those meds were later switched to However, meropenem was later switched to antibiotics after he developed a new rash. The man's fever waned, and he was weaned off oxygen.On day six, the fever returned and the pain in his right hip worsened. An MRI showed acute inflammation, including myositis \u2014 a rare disease characterized by inflamed muscles that can cause muscle fatigue and weakness \u2014 a possibly septic hip and inflammation in his right pelvic bone.As in other cases, blood cultures initially misidentified the bacteria. The Burkholderia pseudomallei was later identified on blood cultures and from a sample of his right hip joint. The patient was discharged to a transitional care facility June 23. He completed eight weeks of intravenous drugs and was given a schedule for eradication therapy. But even after discharge, he remained confused, researchers said, and showed evidence of osteonecrosis of the infected hip joint. In the disease, a lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can replenish new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.In Georgia, a 5-year-old boy was taken to the emergency room July 12 after three days of weakness, fever, tongue swelling, sore throat, nausea and vomiting.Similar to the girl in Texas, he did not have a history of major medical issues. And like the other three cases, he hadn't traveled outside the country.The boy had a fever of about 102 degrees and also had a an abnormally rapid heart beat, as well as intermittent periods of atypically rapid breathing. He also had an elevated white-cell count. Tests showed he was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, more commonly known as the coronavirus. The virus causes the COVID-19 disease.The boy was admitted to the hospital for observation and rehydration. But his oxygen saturation levels fell overnight, and he was moved to an ICU due to concerns of imminent breathing failure. After chest images later showed opacities and fluid in his lungs, the boy was given remdesivir and dexamethasone, common treatments for COVID-19. He as also given anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial drugs, and later an antibiotic used to treat certain serious bacterial infections.But the boy's fever persisted and his breathing continued to deteriorate. On the third day in the hospital, his right arm fell weak. A day later, his pupils became dilated and nonreactive. A CT scan showed a large cerebral infarct. Also called ischemic stroke, the infarction happens when there's disrupted blood flow to the brain, and can cause parts of the brain to die off.The boy's heart and lungs progressively deteriorated despite efforts to resuscitate him. He was left in a vegetative state and died on his fourth day in the hospital.Tests performed during his autopsy showed the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei in his lungs, liver, spleen and brain, as well as COVID-19 in his lungs.Melioidosis was detected in all four patients, who each fell severely ill and who hadn't traveled to places where melioidosis was endemic. However, melioidosis might not have been initially considered because the four had not traveled to areas where the disease is endemic. Additionally, initial tests didn't uncover a Burkholderia pseudomallei infection.Furthermore, the patients in Kansas, Texas and Georgia all received glucocorticoid therapy prior to being diagnosed with melioidosis, which could have contributed to the severity of disease, researchers said.The Georgia boy's coronavirus infection also likely contributed to the severity of his illness. In a previous case, the CDC found that the coronavirus may have reactivated a previous fatal coinfection of Covid-19 and melioidosis in which the SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have reactivated a latent Burkholderia pseudomallei infection.In discussing the four cases, the researchers highlighted the risks associated with exposure to imported products from areas where the bacterium is endemic.\"Health care providers should consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a history of travel to melioidosis-endemic areas,\" the study said. \"In addition, patients who have acute respiratory or neurologic symptoms that do not have a response to initial treatment may be candidates for closer assessment for melioidosis.\"",

  "main_text": "ATLANTA, GA \u2014 A 5-year-old boy in Georgia and a 53-year-old woman in Kansas died from a rare tropical disease \u2014 typically found in South Asia \u2014 that was linked to an imported aromatherapy spray product sold at Walmart stores.That's according to new details published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, which outlined four cases of melioidosis in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and Texas, that were linked to bottles of room sprays from Better Homes and Gardens. The bottles were labeled as a \"highly fragranced essential oil and semi-precious stone infused room spray\" with a \"lavender and chamomile\" scent.And now, the authors say health care professionals should more closely consider melioidosis in patients showing similar symptoms, even if they haven't traveled to places where the disease is endemic.As Patch previously reported, Walmart recalled about 3,900 bottles of \"Better Homes and Gardens Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones.\" The aromatherapy room spray was sold at 55 Walmart stores and online from February 2021 through October 2021 for about $4.One bottle of the essential oil sprays was found to contain Burkholderia pseudomallei, a dangerous bacteria that lives in soil and water and causes the melioidosis infection when ingested, breathed or absorbed through the skin.The infection, also called Whitmore's disease, can lead to skin abscesses in the absence of fever, pneumonia, sepsis, organ abscesses, genital infection, and inflamed brain or spinal cord.Most melioidosis cases are reported in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Northern Australia, as well as several other South Asia countries, though there have been cases reported in Puerto Rico, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Central and South America, and parts of Africa and the Middle East, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But in America, cases are exceedingly rare. About a dozen are reported to the CDC each year, and the vast majority are linked to travel to areas where melioidosis is endemic.

  "main_text": "Source: XinhuaEditor: huaxia2022-03-03 21:50:45ABUJA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Two medical doctors have been confirmed killed by Lassa fever in the past 72 hours in Nigeria's southwestern state of Oyo, a medical association said on Thursday.In a statement, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) described the outbreak of Lassa fever in the country as \"another onslaught,\" noting that it broke out \"while we thought that COVID-19 had done its worst.\"\"We are worried about other health workers who have had contact with the deceased unknowingly,\" the NMA said, adding it had advised other affected health workers to be quarantined and treat all febrile illnesses with a high index of suspicion.Lassa fever is usually transmitted when the saliva, urine, and excreta of multi-mammalian rats come into contact with humans through their food or water. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through contact with the body fluids of an infected person.In some cases, Lassa fever has similar symptoms to malaria, appearing between one and three weeks after exposure to the virus. In mild cases, the disease causes fever, fatigue, weakness, and headache.As part of measures to contain the outbreak among medical workers, the NMA said it had directed the frontline doctors and other health workers to wear appropriate personal protective equipment at all times.On Saturday, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) said the death toll of Lassa fever in the most populous African country had risen to 86 as of Feb. 21.The NCDC said 74 out of the country's 774 local government areas have been affected by this hemorrhagic fever since January.The case fatality rate in the country so far this year has reached 19.1 percent, the NCDC said.The NCDC said it is distributing medical response commodities to states and treatment centers, as part of measures to control the spread.Nigeria has activated the national multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary Lassa fever emergency operations center in response to the outbreak since late January.  \u25a0",

  "main_text": "Victorian health authorities have confirmed a man in his 60s died from the mosquito-borne Japanese Encephalitis Virus.A Victorian man in his 60s has died after contracting the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV).Victorian health authorities confirmed an autopsy had revealed his death on February 28 was due to the deadly virus.This is the first fatality from the virus in Victoria from seven confirmed JEV cases.Victoria Health is now conducting investigations into how the man contracted the deadly virus.JEV is spread by mosquitoes and can infect both animals and humans and has been confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in regional NSW.The virus can cause serious illness, such as encephalitis, in roughly one per cent of those who are infected.Stream more national news live & on demand with Flash, Australia's biggest news streaming service. New to Flash? Try 1 month free now.On Monday New South Wales had two residents hospitalised with JEV while Queensland last week issued an urgent health alert after a human case was recorded.NSW Health on Monday confirmed a man and a child from the NSW-Victoria border region were receiving hospital treatment.The man remains in a serious condition in ICU while the child was discharged from intensive care but remains in hospital due to the \u201cserious nature\u201d of their illness.The Queensland case was a resident who recently travelled in regional southern Queensland and is in a Brisbane hospital.Agriculture Minister David Littleproud explained the cause of the rise in cases as he admitted the government was concerned but not panicking.\u201cWe\u2019re monitoring it closely with state agencies as well but effectively it\u2019s come about from the significant wet weather that we\u2019ve had spread right across the eastern seaboard,\u201d he told Sky News political editor.The majority of those who contract JEV will experience none or very mild symptoms and have a full recovery.However health authorities have warned those who develop a sudden onset of fever, headache, vomiting as well as seizures or disorientation should immediately seek medical attention.Children aged under five and older people infected with JEV are at a higher risk of developing severe illnesses such as encephalitis.There are JEV vaccines available and health authorities recommend them to anyone who works with or around pigs including transport workers, vets visiting pig farms and people hunting pigs.Mr Littleproud said the government was working to ensure those people in risk areas were getting their vaccine.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really narrow down those risk areas to make sure that it is a targeted approach and that approach is around vaccines,\u201d he said.The Agriculture Minister said the government had about 6,000 vaccines in storage before cases emerged and had ordered another 6,000 from Korea with more on the way.\u201cTo make sure that if this does get further than the 21 piggeries across the east coast and South Australia that we will be able to target this,\u201d he said.Mr Littleproud said the government had handed the vaccines to the state governments who were targeting those working in piggeries.\u201cThey\u2019ve been targeting some local communities but local health authorities are working through that,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to act within both Health and Agriculture to move quickly to get vaccines but also to make sure that councils are doing work around trying to eradicate mosquitoes in some of those areas where there\u2019s water laying.\u201dTo join the conversation, please\n log in.

Rats, the carrier of the virus, are frequently sighted at the farm he works at, according to the man.He started exhibiting symptoms of the disease including fever, chills, and muscle pain on Feb. 12. The symptoms persisted, so he sought medical assistance on Feb. 14, after which he was hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus, said the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The man has been discharged from the hospital and is in stable condition. Contacts and people who live with him have not shown symptoms, while disinfection and an investigation have been carried out at the horse ranch.Taiwan reported ten hantavirus cases in 2021, including people in Kaohsiung, Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Changhua, and Taichung, per the CDC.Hantavirus is contracted through contact with rodent urine or feces, rodent bites, or objects contaminated with the virus. Some strains could result in severe diseases in humans, such as hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which may cause diarrhea, vomiting, renal failure, and even death.People are advised to sanitize their living environment and storage facilities with a diluted bleach solution to prevent the spread of the disease.Updated : 2022-03-15 09:53 GMT+08:00Taiwan News  \u00a9  2019 All Rights Reserved.",

There is no impact on the consumption of properly cooked poultry products including eggs.To limit the spread of disease, the Government introduced housing measures in November which means that all bird keepers \u2013 whether it is someone who has pet birds or a few chickens, ducks or geese in the back yard to holders of commercial flocks - are legally required to keep them housed and to follow strict biosecurity measures. If strict biosecurity measures are maintained by poultry keepers, the risk of an outbreak of the disease would be low at their premises.Key advice for poultry keepers includes to:House or net all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds;Cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds \u2013 if practical, use disposable protective clothing;Reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control;Thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis;Keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points;Minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds.These housing measures will be kept under regular review.Although the risk to human health from the virus is low, people can catch bird flu via direct contact with a live or dead bird carrying the virus or via direct contact with bird faeces from a bird carrying the virus.",

(WHNT) \u2013 A second case of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) was recently detected in a sample from a white-tailed deer killed in Lauderdale County.According to a news release from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR), CWD is a progressive, fatal disease among white-tailed deer and other deer spieces that results in altered behavior.Animals may carry the disease for years without signs, but as it progresses, the animal may show signs like listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, lack of response, and repetitive walking in a set pattern.After the first case was detected in January, ADCNR designated all of Colbert and Lauderdale counties as CWD Management Zones (CMZ). The areas west of U.S. Highway 43 in Lauderdale to the Mississippi and Tennessee state lines and south of the Tennessee River are a \u201chigh-risk zone,\u201d while the remainder of both counties is considered a buffer zone.Samples were collected from 966 white-tailed deer harvested within the CMZ during the 2021-2022 hunting season. The Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries found one additional positive case while testing the samples.After analyzing the results, ADCNR is suspending the use of supplemental wildlife feeding and baiting privileges within the CMZ. The suspension does not apply to bird feeders within 100 feet of a building or occupied dwelling or feed inside an active feral hog trap.\u201cThe suspension of supplemental feeding and baiting privileges in Lauderdale and Colbert counties is an attempt to slow the spread of CWD in the affected area,\u201d said Chris Blankenship, ADCNR Commissioner. \u201cWe take the presence of this disease very seriously and are utilizing our CWD Strategic Surveillance and Response Plan to manage it. Our staff is prepared, and the Department will do whatever is prudent and reasonable to protect the state\u2019s deer resources and our hunting culture.\u201dSupplemental feeding and baiting privileges are still allowed outside of the CMZ.For more information, visit\u00a0www.outdooralabama.com/cwd-info.Submit\u0394document.getElementById( \"ak_js_1\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() );Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc.

  "headline": "ALABAMA - Bats In Clarke County Found Positive For Rabies - Precautions Urged",
  "main_text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: Dee W. Jones, D.V.M., (334) 206-5969Two bats recently found around a personal residence in Clarke County tested positive for rabies. This has caused local and state health authorities to issue a reminder about the potential for bats to transmit rabies. Bats, along with raccoons, are the primary reservoirs for rabies in Alabama. Rabies is a viral infection in mammals that is transmitted by bites, scratches or other contact with infected saliva. Rabies virus is present only in saliva and nervous tissue; it is not transmitted through contact with guano (bat feces), blood or urine from infected animals.Estimates vary, but generally it is estimated that 0.5 to 2 percent of the bat population is positive for rabies. Bats that are not able to fly or that are out during the day have a higher incidence of being positive for rabies. Laboratory testing is the only definitive method for identifying rabies positive bats that may have exposed humans. In 2021, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) reported 13 laboratory-confirmed rabies-positive bats.Although bats can pose a public health risk, they are a very important species to nature. They consume insects, biting pests and pollinate flowers. Dr. Dee W. Jones, State Public Health Veterinarian, says, \u201cProblems arise when bats and humans inhabit the same dwellings. It is common for bats to roost in the rafters and attics of houses, schools or other buildings and occasionally some of the bats can get inside of the living quarters. The age of the building doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate the risk of having a bat roost. We have investigated reports of roosts in newer buildings and sports stadiums on school campuses, as well as older buildings in the community.\u201dAccording to Dr. Jones, the most important step to take following a potential bat exposure is to safely collect it and preserve it for testing. He states, \u201cThe challenge is collecting the bat without further exposing yourself, so gloves should be worn, and a shovel, net or other tool can be used to avoid touching it if possible.\u201dRabies is a fatal disease if left untreated, but is preventable if proper treatment is received soon following the bite or scratch. Anyone exposed to a bat should consult with a medical provider immediately. Vaccination for pets 12 weeks of age and older is required by state law.The ADPH recommends that people should follow the advice of wildlife officials, licensed exterminators and contractors on how to exclude bats from a building. Follow these basic steps to best protect yourself and pets from exposure to bats and rabies:Please refer to alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/rabies.html for more advice about bat infestations and exposures.For more information about rabies risk locally or in Alabama, please contact the Clarke County Health Department (251) 275-3772 or call ADPH at (334) 206-5969.-30-3/7/22County health departments throughout Alabama provide a wide range of confidential and professional services.

  "main_text": "Two NSW residents diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis virusFollow our live blog for the latest on Russia's invasion of UkraineNSW's first-ever locally acquired human cases of the potentially deadly Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) have been detected in a man and a child living near the border with Victoria.Health officials say other patients are being tested for the mosquito-borne virus and more cases are expected to be confirmed in coming days.One of the cases, a man from the Corowa area, was the probable case first reported by NSW Health on Friday.The man remains in a serious condition in an ICU ward at a Victorian hospital.The second case is a child from the Wentworth area in the far south-west of NSW. The child has been discharged from ICU but continues to receive hospital care.NSW Health is concerned about the spread of JEV in the border region and is calling on the community to take care not to be bitten by mosquitoes.JEV is an illness developed in pigs and horses and spread by infected mosquitoes.It can be fatal for humans, however, less than 1 per cent of infected people develop symptoms.The virus has now been detected in four Australian states, an outbreak which has been declared a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance by the Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sonya Bennett.Japanese encephalitis is a rare virus that in serious cases can cause your brain to swell.There is a vaccine but no specific treatment for JEV, which can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.The virus cannot be spread person-to-person or through eating animals.Mosquito control activities are being carried out near farms where pigs are confirmed to have been infected by JEV, and NSW Health is arranging vaccination of workers on affected farms.NSW Health acting chief health officer\u00a0Dr Marianne Gale said the best thing people can do to protect themselves against JEV is to take steps to avoid mosquito bites.\u201cWe are working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and other states and territories to determine the extent to which the virus is circulating,\u201d Dr Gale said.\u201cUnfortunately, our recent wet weather has led to very high mosquito numbers, so we need the community to be particularly vigilant and take steps to avoid mosquito bites.\u201cWe know mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn, and we need people planning activities near waterways or where mosquitoes are present to be especially cautious, particularly those in the vicinity of the Murray River and its branches.\u201dWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",

  "main_text": "ABC RuralJapanese encephalitis outbreak reaches SA as authorities race to control outbreakFollow our live blog for the latest on Russia's invasion of UkraineThe outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is now impacting four states\u00a0as public health officials work to contain it.Since the potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus was first detected near the New South Wales-Victoria border last week, cases have been recorded in Queensland and South Australia.A\u00a0Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said three cases of\u00a0Japanese encephalitis had been confirmed in humans, and a\u00a0number of possible cases were under investigation.The spokesperson said it\u00a0was anticipated that more cases would be confirmed shortly.Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer Mark Schipp said\u00a0animals at 21 piggeries had\u00a0been infected.\"We're mapping the presence of waterbirds, feral pigs\u00a0or piggeries and people that have contracted the infection,\" he said.\"We're undertaking mosquito surveillance and mosquito control on those farms.\"There is a vaccine available as well.\"That's the purpose of the mapping that we're undertaking at the moment \u2014 to prioritise those vaccinations and then rolling the vaccinations out further from there,\" Mr Schipp said.The movement of pigs on farms with positive cases is being restricted.Pork SA chairman Andrew Johnson is urging pork producers to report suspected cases.\"Farmers that see any symptoms, they shouldn't be afraid to advise accordingly,\" he said.JE cannot be transmitted to humans by eating pork products and producers will still be able to transport livestock to abattoirs.\"If there's a suspect case, or if there is a positive case, those farms will be issued a movement permit that will allow them to continue business,\" Mr Johnson said.The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and cannot be passed from livestock to humans.Japanese encephalitis is a rare virus that in serious cases can cause your brain to swell.\"Japanese encephalitis is a virus carried by mosquitoes from water birds or pigs to humans or horses,\" Mr Schipp said.\"Pigs are an amplifying host, so they produce a lot of virus and the mosquitoes pick that up and carry it forward into humans and horses.\"JE is not normally found in Australia and\u00a0health officials survey the Torres Strait and the Top End every year to check for outbreaks.This outbreak has been found along the Murray River corridor.Mr Schipp said it was\u00a0surprising to find JE so far south.\"It will have a large impact on human health and industry,\" he said.\"The impacts on tourism, for example, could be significant.\"We're doing everything we can to try and minimise its spread and ensure that people are vaccinated.\"We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",

  "headline": "UNITED KINGDOM - New Bird Flu Case Reported In Eden",
  "main_text": "A case of Avian Influenza has been confirmed at a premises north of Kirkoswald in Eden.Poultry keepers are urged not to be complacent and to undertake urgent biosecurity measures to help stop the spread of bird flu as new cases are being reported in Cumbria.So far, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 had been reported at Silecroft in Copeland and near Aspatria. A case has also been found in Annan.It means that 3km protection and 10km surveillance zones are now in place around the areas where infection has been identified.The zones restrict access to locations where birds are kept and impose restrictions on the movement of birds. They do not limit access to residents, or business owners. The protection and surveillance zones will apply until the zone is withdrawn or amended by DEFRA.With the backdrop of the UK facing its larger ever outbreak of bird flu with over 60 cases confirmed across the country since the start of November 2021, the UK\u2019s Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss is calling on poultry keepers to take action to help stop the spread.To help mitigate the spread of disease, The Government introduced new housing measures last month, which means that if you keep chickens, ducks, geese or any other birds you are now legally required to keep them indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures.If you do not do this, the disease could kill your birds and you may face a fine. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months and other wildlife spread the disease so it is vital not to allow wild birds to mix with your chickens, ducks, geese or other birds.People can also spread the disease on clothing and shoes so, before going into bird enclosures you should wash your hands, and change, or clean and disinfect your footwear.The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency has said that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry or eggs.The Chief Veterinary Officer is reminding all poultry keepers that whilst the main source of infection comes from migratory wild birds, those failing to implement these measures risk infecting their own flocks by walking the virus into their holdings.Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said, \u201cWe have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease including introducing housing measures. However, we are seeing a growing number of bird flu cases both on commercial farms and in backyard birds right across the country.\u201cMany poultry keepers have excellent biosecurity standards, but the number of cases we are seeing suggests that not enough is being done to keep bird flu out. Whether you keep just a few birds, or thousands you must take action now to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.\u201cImplementing scrupulous biosecurity has never been more critical. You must regularly clean and disinfect your footwear and clothes before entering enclosures, stop your birds mixing with any wild birds and only allow visitors that are strictly necessary. It is your actions that will help keep your birds safe.\u201dPoultry and captive bird keepers must be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds and seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns.Keepers are urged to register their flocks with the Animal and Plant Health Agency and Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. This is a legal requirement if you have 50 birds or more.Registering means that they will be able to contact you with information or action required should an outbreak happen near you. Do not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that you find.If you find dead swans, geese or ducks or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. For further information see the\u00a0advice for the public at www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu.Bird keepers should report suspicion of disease in England to Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. In Scotland, contact your local Field Services Office. Keepers should familiarise themselves with the avian flu advice at\u00a0www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu.",

(AP) \u2014 Federal inspectors have confirmed the presence of bird flu in a commercial mixed species flock in southeastern South Dakota.Samples from the flock in Charles Mix County, which borders Nebraska, were tested at a national laboratory at South Dakota State University. The property was quarantined and the birds will be killed to prevent spread of the disease, the Agriculture Department said.Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.The highly contagious virus was discovered a month ago in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana and was detected earlier this week in a backyard flock of chickens and ducks in western Iowa.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.Birds from the South Dakota flock will not enter the food system, the USDA said.",

  "headline": "INDIA - Up Polls - Over 40 Lives Recently Lost To Deadly Malaria - Healthcare Not A Poll Plank In So",
  "main_text": "SUBSCRIBE AND SUPPORTSonbhadra (Uttar Pradesh): Pratibha, 23, entered a wedlock with Ajay Kumar Prajapati, 25, on April 23, 2017. Two children were born to the couple. One is a three-year-old and the other is six months. In August 2021, Pratibha developed fever \u2014 which would often spike despite constant medication. She was expecting her youngest child and was seven months pregnant at that time.She was admitted to a private hospital for 15 days. She tested Pf positive (Plasmodium falciparum \u2014 a parasite, which causes the deadliest form of malaria). The second time her condition deteriorated, she was rushed to the local Hindalco Hospital \u2014 where doctors referred her to the district hospital at Robertsganj (also known as Sonbhadra). She delivered her baby there. Soon after the delivery, she was referred again to Sir Sunderlal Hospital at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU).Twenty-four hours after her admission there, she died on October 3, 2021. Her death certificate noted that she died of CVA (cerebrovascular accident, causing sudden death of some brain cells), postpartum sepsis (which occurs when bacteria infect the uterus and surrounding areas after a woman gives birth) and cardiopulmonary arrest (sudden loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness).Notably, none of her medical records was handed over to her family \u2014 except the death certificate.Pratibha\u2019s mother-in-law, Phoolmati, who cooks midday meals at a local primary school, is now taking care of the toddler.Ajay's mother Phoolmati with her grandson whose mother Pratibha passed away soon after his birth. \u200b\u201cNot only that I lost my life partner who was always with me in all highs and lows, my children lost their mother at such a young age. I did what I could do to save her, but failed. Now, I don\u2019t know how my child will be raised,\u201d Ajay, a resident of Markara village in Myorpur block from Sonbhadra district\u2019s Dudhi tehsil (sub-district), told NewsClick.He is heavily indebted as he spent on her treatment Rs 1.2 lakh, which he has borrowed in three instalments from a private moneylender.His child is so malnourished and underweight that he could not be vaccinated. \u201cI have suggested to his grandmother that they feed her cow\u2019s milk, but they are unable to do it for two reasons: their financial condition and cow milk is deficient in this area,\u201d said Parwati, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) stationed at Makara Public Health Centre (PHC).Ajay\u2019s suffering did not end here. Fifteen days after his wife Pratibha\u2019s death, his 14-month-old niece (sister\u2019s daughter), Sarita, breathed her last on September 18, 2021. She too was found positive for the fatal Pf. After her fever shot up, she was taken to a hospital. She died on the way.Sarita was said to have contracted the infection from her lactating mother, Kusum, 23, who was also tested positive for malaria parasite. When her daughter died, she was admitted to a private hospital at Robertsganj and given five units of platelets and two units of blood.The mother of a three-year-old son, she had earlier lost a 14-month baby to the disease.The dangerous disease has been wreaking havoc in at least six hamlets (Makara, Gadha, Bijul Jhariya, Aghariyah Didh Bodhrahwan, Ban Paisa) of Sindur Makara and Pati gram panchayats (village-governing bodies) in Sonbhadra\u2019s Myorpur block close, to the industrial town of Renukoot.At least 40 deaths have been reported in the last two months in these hamlets, which together have a population of around 6,000 people.Gond tribe, which is listed among the Scheduled Tribes (ST), makes up the bulk of the population here. According to the Census 2011, Sonbhadra\u2019s population is made up of around 23% Scheduled Castes and 21% Scheduled Tribes.The villages are also inhabited by Other Backward Castes (OBC) such as Prajapati and Patel whose condition is no better.The recent deaths and the saga of helplessness, however, have failed to shake the conscience of the government. The local administration or the government have not developed any infrastructure or additional facilities to ensure that the endemic does not return.Close to Ajay\u2019s house lives 47-year-old Amravati and 65-year-old Manghi in a thatched, dilapidated house made of clay, straw and reeds. Both daughter- and mother-in-law duo lost their husbands to the disease. The family is now left with no male members \u2013 on whom the two women typically relied on for their livelihood.Amravati's husband, Ram Pyare (48) died on August 15, 2021. He was sick with fever and abdominal pain. After his body temperature and the pain did not subside despite medication, he was taken to the Sonbhadra\u2019s district hospital where he was admitted and underwent treatment for a week. Even after several medical examinations, doctors were clueless about the disease.He was referred to the BHU\u2019s medical college and hospital in Varanasi. But before he could be shifted, he breathed his last. He was reported to have been suffering from typhoid and malaria coinfection.Five days after Pyare\u2019s death, his father, Ram Baran (70), too, died of malaria on August 20 last year after suffering from fever for two days. Because of the abject poverty and finances already drained due to the son\u2019s medical treatment, Ram Baran could not be taken to any hospital.Amravati (L) with her mother-in-law Manghi (R). Both lost their husbands to malaria.Now, Amravati has to sustain her only minor son and the ailing mother-in-law, who is unable to walk properly. \u201cNaa puchin saahib ki pariwar kaise chalat hai (don\u2019t ask us how we are surviving),\u201d said the visibly upset woman who hardly gets any work to earn livelihood.It is the people around her who keep extending financial help to keep the family running. \u201cWe only get free ration from the government and nothing else. There are no old age and widow pensions,\u201d she added.Residents from these six hamlets told NewsClick that a majority of them (about 90%, claimed some) are deprived of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY), under which a sum of Rs 1.30 lakh is given to people in rural areas for construction of a pucca house. They have no reliable source of employment. They are allotted work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREGA) Act, 2005, \u201conce in a blue moon\u201d, but don\u2019t get payment for months together or even for as long as a year.The villages have only one PHC at Makara where no doctor was available when NewsClick visited during the working hours. Two employees and an ANM (Parwati) were present at the health centre who said that the \u201cdoctor saheb has just left\u201d.One of the officials, refusing to be named, said that the PHC caters to a large area only, but only one MBBS doctor is deputed here.The state is facing a shortfall of 2,277 doctors. Its 942 primary health centres (PHCs) continue to operate without electricity, regular water supply and all-weather motorable approach road. The PHCs in the state have the worst patient-to-doctor ratio and infrastructure in the country to cater to the poorest patients.Around two kilometres from Makara lies Gadha village where Uday Raj Gaud, 70, died 10 months back \u2013 just three days after he developed fever. He also had tested positive for malaria parasite.\u201cThe election of pradhans (village heads) was going on, and he was actively engaged in campaigning. One day, after he returned from the poll canvassing in the area, he complained of fever, breathlessness, and seizure. We rushed him to Hindalco Hospital where doctors refused to admit him. We did not have resources to take him to either a private hospital or district hospital, which is around 50 kilometres away from here; and therefore, we consulted quacks who also refused to treat him given his serious condition. He breathed his last as we were planning to rush him to the BHU\u2019s medical college,\u201d narrated Kalpa.Not even two months had passed when Uday\u2019s 30-year-old son, Ram Charan \u2014 a father of four minors \u2014 died of malaria. He was unwell for one month. \u201cHe had become so weak that he had stopped all movement a few days before his death,\u201d said his family members.The family has 1.5 bigha (0.92 acre) of land between two brothers.The people in these villages have very small landholdings. Because of being a water-deficient region, they depend mainly on rainfall. Due to low levels of groundwater (at a depth of 200-250 feet), irrigation using wells is not feasible. Pumping water from such a depth is expensive as well and not affordable to most of the residents here.Mainly chana (gram), arhar (pigeon pea), masoor (lentil), mustard, onion, and wheat are grown here for household uses. The residents here don\u2019t do agricultural farming for commercial purposes as yield is too low in the water-starved region.Of the total 250 pucca houses in the two panchayats, with around 5,000 residences, 100 have been constructed recently under the PMAY. The remaining 150 houses were constructed under the Indira Awas Yojna.When the malaria deaths made the headlines in November last year, the district administration seemed to have woken up from its slumber. All high-ranking officials visited the affected villages. But months later, nothing seems to have been done to prevent the tragedy in future.BJP MLA and minister Sanjeev Kumar Gond, who represents Obra (reserved) constituency (under which these hamlets fall), too had reached the villages and cited contaminated drinking water as the reason for the deaths.Villagers were supplied drinking water through water tankers for some time. They were promised that water treatment plants would be set up in the villages, but nothing has happened so far. Even the temporary water supply has been stopped. The villagers are once again drinking the same \u201ccontaminated\u201d water they get from the open wells in the region.Gond, the minister for social welfare in the state government, had also promised that the deceased people\u2019s families would receive some compensation, but it turned out to be a lip service.Talking about the prevailing situation in the affected villages, Sonbhadra\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr Nem Singh claimed, \u201cWe are continuously running awareness campaigns. Malaria deaths have come down significantly. The officials who were found guilty of negligence have been removed from the areas, and show cause notices have been served to them.\u201dHe said that the Health Department is carrying out continuous fogging in the affected areas.\u201cWater samples have also been taken. Every single death in these areas is being audited. We cannot force anyone to get medical treatments only from government hospitals, but we are constantly making people aware of the good and free treatment government hospitals provide,\u201d he said.The villagers contradicted the claims, saying that the fogging had been done only once in November last year. They also showed details of the fogging written on the walls of most of the houses.Unfortunately, this is not an issue in the ongoing elections. Representatives belonging to different political parties are reaching out to the villagers and giving them assurances. Though the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\u2019s flags unfurling atop almost every house in the villages is a common sight here, voters don\u2019t seem to vovalise their support to the ruling party.OBRA CONSTITUENCY AT A GLANCEObra is one of the 403 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly constituencies, which falls under the Sonbhadra district. The election will be held here on March 7 in the final phase.In 2017, the Obra Assembly seat had 3,07,992 registered voters. Of them, 1,69,473 were male and 1,38,519 were female voters. 1.4% of the votes were casted for NOTA.In 2017, 11 candidates were competing for the Obra Assembly constituency seat. Obra was one of 312 seats won by the BJP. It was a one-way contest with BJP\u2019s Sanjiv Kumar comfortably winning the election, defeating Samajwadi Party\u2019s Ravi Gond by a huge margin of 44,269 votes.The top three candidates split 88.9% of the votes among them. The BJP got a total of 78,058 votes, while the SP secured 33,789 votes. Bahujan Samaj Party\u2019s candidate Virendra Pratap Singh grabbed the third spot with 29,113 votes. The top three parties got 49.2%, 21.3% and 18.4% of the votes respectively.Bahujan Samaj Party\u2019s Sunil Kumar had defeated BJP\u2019s Devendra Prasad Shastri by 7,060 votes in the 2012 elections.This time, the BJP and the SP are engaged in an intense face-off, with observers unable to make strong predictions.Subscribe and Support",

The bacteria can come into contact with food and drink through contact with surfaces where the bacteria is located.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube\u201cThat means you do not have to worry about it being transmitted through the air, like if someone sneezed on you or any of that.

  "main_text": "NewsDesk\u00a0@bactiman63The Israel Ministry of Health reported today a case of polio (child paralysis) in a 4-year-old child in Jerusalem who was unvaccinated.The source of the disease in this case, a polio virus that has undergone changes and may cause disease in those who are not vaccinated.This is the first case in Israel since 1989.The Jerusalem District Health Bureau has opened an epidemiological investigation and will contact the child in close contact to provide specific instructions. Based on the findings of the investigation, further recommendations will be decided.It should be noted that the virus is found in sewage samples in the area, a finding that occurs occasionally, but so far in similar incidents in the past there have been no clinical cases.The most important means of preventing polio is to adhere to routine immunizations at the recommended time according to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health. It is recommended to complete routine immunizations as soon as possible for those who have not yet done so.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTubePolio is an infectious disease caused by the polio virus. The virus is contagious and is transmitted from person to person (especially in children). The virus enters the body through the mouth and is excreted in the feces. There are usually no signs of illness and only one in a thousand people (who are not vaccinated) will develop symptoms symptomatically with paralysis.Health officials will continue to update the public as needed as the investigation progresses.Excellent text.

  "main_text": "By Chris King \u2022 06 March 2022 \u2022 0:30Two new outbreaks of bird flu in Andalucia.\nImage: PixabayAuthorities in the province of Sevilla have reported the detection of two new outbreaks of bird flu. This brings the total in Andalucia to 22 cases.The Ministry of Agriculture announced today, Saturday, March 5, that these two latest discoveries have been uncovered on turkey farms in the municipalities of Estepa and El Rubio, both inside the restricted area laid out after \u200b\u200bthe previous reported outbreaks.Of the 22 poultry farms affected in Andalucia, six are in the province of Huelva, and the rest are in Sevilla. The farm in El Rubio has around 10,000 turkeys with a mortality rate of about 80 per cent, while in Estapa, the farm has approximately 24,000 birds, with almost 90 per cent mortality.Following the established procedure, the Veterinary Services of the Junta de Andalucia immediately sent the first birds showing symptoms compatible with the disease, and an increase in mortality, to the Central Laboratory in Algete. This is the National Reference Laboratory for avian influenza.According to the source, once again, it is a strain of the H5N1 subtype, the same one that has appeared in recent months in different parts of the European continent.There is no evidence that H5N1 can be passed to humans, although it is recommended not to expose oneself to birds that show symptoms compatible with bird flu, or are found dead outdoors.There are an estimated 5 million birds on about 600 farms within the current restriction zones. To facilitate the movement of birds from within these areas the Ministry of Agriculture has established a channelled exit procedure to the slaughterhouse, which is being carried out in coordination with the Health authorities.Andalucia\u2019s official veterinary services are putting into measures into practice that are necessary to control the active foci of this avian influenza, while establishing the corresponding surveillance and protection tasks. It is also working on the prevention of the spread of the disease in Andalucia, as reported by laopiniondemalaga.es.___________________________________________________________Thank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check\u00a0The Euro Weekly News\u00a0website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.Share this storySubscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don\u2019t already have one.

Chance of rain 100%.Updated: March 14, 2022 @ 8:26 pmH5N1 avian influenza, which is deadly to poultry, is creeping closer to Arkansas.A deadly strain of avian flu is creeping closer to Arkansas, having claimed a commercial broiler flock in southeastern Missouri.The H5N1 strain is highly pathogenic and highly contagious among birds. The Missouri flock was in Stoddard County, just above the Bootheel.\u201cThe detection of the virus in multiple states, and especially close in Missouri, is highly suggestive that it is either currently in birds now migrating over Arkansas or will be shortly,\u201d said Dustan Clark, extension veterinarian for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. \u201cI cannot stress enough the importance of not only reviewing, but also implementing appropriate biosecurity measures.\u201dThe disease has been found in Maryland, Maine, New York, Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, Delaware, Michigan, Connecticut and Iowa. In those 10 states, it has affected eight backyard flocks, seven turkey flocks, a captive wild bird group and two flocks of layers.Maryland was the latest confirmed infection, announced Saturday by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Clark emphasized that the disease poses no threat to humans and that both chicken and turkey are safe to eat.The Cooperative Extension Service has biosecurity resources on its website.

  "main_text": "NewsDesk\u00a0@bactiman63The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Thursday that the number of hospital visits for diarrhea in the country has increased recently, and the pathogens detected in cluster incidents are mainly norovirus.The public is advised to pay attention to food safety and hand hygiene. Seek medical attention as soon as possible and take rest at home if you are sick; catering and accommodation operators must strengthen environmental hygiene management and pay attention to the health status of employees. If you have suspected symptoms, please suspend work immediately to reduce the risk of virus transmission.According to the monitoring data of the CDC, there were a total of 110,783 outpatient and emergency visits for diarrhea in Taiwan last week (February 20 to February 26), a slight increase from the number of visits in the past two weeks (109,522 in the 7th and 6th weeks, 109,289), but lower than the same period in recent years. In previous years, the number of patients with diarrhea was likely to increase after consecutive holidays.

  "main_text": "Kenya's acting Health Director-General, Dr Patrick Amoth. PHOTO | SILA KIPLAGAT | NATION MEDIA GROUPKenya has declared a yellow fever outbreak after Isiolo County, in upper eastern Oregon, reported new cases, a statement by the Ministry of Health states.Three people have died while more than 20 people contracted the yellow fever virus in Imerti and Garbatulla Sub-counties in the last one month, the notice signed by acting Director-General of Health, Dr Patrick Amoth, said.In the March 5 report, the Ministry noted that out of the six samples that were tested by the Kenya Medical Research Institute, three of them turned positive and an alert has since been sent to all the 47 counties. Counties bordering Isiolo have been placed in the high-risk bracket.Dr Amoth said the first case was detected on January 12 and since then, 15 suspected cases have been identified presenting with symptoms including headache, fever, jaundice, muscles and joint pains.Amongst the patients, the youngest is an 11-year-old while the oldest is 65. Young male adults are the majority of the infected.\"This\u00a0is, therefore, to raise an alarm in all the 47 counties more so the high-risk counties including Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot and Turkana,\" the statement says.Uganda MPs concerned that rising political temperatures in Kenya have driven up cost of living along the Northern Corridor.He last visited Kigali on January 22 where he held talks with President Kagame over the restoration of bilateral ties.",

A further six bird carcasses from the park were handed in this week and staff believe the same strain of flu is to blame.\"The risk to public health is very low but as a precautionary measure the Council is asking all members of the public not to hand-feed birds at any of its parks or country parks.\"\"If you find a dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Animal Plant and Health Agency (APHA) on 03459 33 55 77. Any visibly sick birds should also be reported via this number and must not be touched or handled.\"To get the latest newsletters from CardiffOnline click here.37 fascinating pictures of Cardiff's Roath that will take you back",

A sanitary inspector conducts a search-and-destroy operation against breeding sites of mosquitoes Friday (March 4, 2022) in Barangay San Roque, Zamboanga City as dengue cases soar to 338 with nine deaths since January. The city health office reminded residents to always protect themselves from dengue through the 4S strategy. (Photo courtesy of Zamboanga CIO)ZAMBOANGA CITY \u2013 The city health office on Friday reminded residents to practice the four \u201cS\u201d strategy against dengue, an acute viral infection that affects mostly children and infants, following a continuing increase in the number of cases here.Dr. Dulce Amor Miravite, city health officer, issued the reminder as dengue cases in the city reached the 338 mark with nine mortalities since January this year.The four \u201cS\u201d campaign stands for: Search and destroy mosquito-breeding sites; secure Self-protection measures like wearing long pants and long-sleeve shirts and daily use of mosquito repellent; Seek early consultation; and, Support fogging or spraying only in hotspot areas where an increase in cases is registered for two consecutive weeks to prevent an impending outbreak.\u201cAs we can see, we are experiencing rain at night, so we have to destroy the breeding sites of mosquitoes,\u201d Miravite said.She said the dengue fatalities came from the barangays of Bolong, Mercedes, Tictapul, Camino Nuevo, Tetuan, Sinunuc, Buenavista and Sta. Catalina.She noted that six of the city\u2019s 98 barangays have a high number of dengue cases reported from January.The six barangays and their respective dengue cases are as follows: Mercedes, 15; Culianan, nine; Divisoria, nine; Zambowood, nine; Lanzones, three; and, Quiniput, three.Dengue virus is spread to people through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.The mosquito can be recognized by white markings on its legs and a pattern in the form of a lyre on the upper surface of its thorax.The most common symptoms of dengue fever are nausea, vomiting, rashes, aches, and pain such as eye pain, typically behind the eyes, muscle, joint, or bone pain.

  "main_text": "PIGGERIES IMPACTED: SunPork Group managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld says several of their piggeries have been impacted by JEV. Dr van Barneveld is pictured here speaking at Swickers' boning facility reopening at Kingaroy in 2018. Photo: Martin BunyardAustralia's biggest pork producer has confirmed several of its piggeries have been impacted by Japanese encephalitis virus.Australia's biggest pork producer SunPork has confirmed its piggeries have been impacted by Japanese encephalitis virus.JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals - mostly pigs and horses.SunPork Group CEO and managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld said several of their sites in the eastern states had been impacted and they were working through it.\"One of the Goondiwindi farms has been infected ... we have an infected premises in New South Wales ... There are infected premises all down the east coast,\" Dr van Barneveld said.\"We've been working on this endlessly since Friday night when we first were made aware that it was an issue.\"Dr van Barneveld said it was not a new occurrence and there was no cause for alarm in the pork industry.\"The piggeries are innocent bystanders. Pigs are not going to infect other pigs. It's not going to have a negative effect at an abattoir. The pork is safe to eat. It's play on,\" he said.\"If you're going to have an emergency animal disease, this is the one to have. We're not actually anticipating any significant disruption to our operations at all.\"Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.Humans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.\"If a mosquito bites people and if it bites horses, they're called dead end hosts, so it doesn't pass on. If it bites a pig - a pig's an amplifier - so if another mosquito bites that pig while it's viremic, which is a very short period of time, it can transmit in the mosquito population,\" Dr van Barneveld said.\"That's why there are controls around the movement of pigs.\"Dr van Barneveld said authorities were working well together to protect humans and animals.\"This is about protecting people and the bad guy in the process is a mosquito and the weather patterns,\" he said.\"The state health departments and the state chief veterinary officers have worked extremely well together. They understand that eradicating it is going to be very unlikely and they're being very practical around the movement of pigs and making sure people are safe.\"He said SunPork had done a lot of preparedness work around African Swine Fever and had good relationships with the state chief veterinary officers which puts it in a very good position to manage this.\"When you get a disease like this, there are a whole stack of legislative instruments that are pushed into place that have to be executed, and they're following those processes.\"Everyone's fairly calm about it and think we can manage through it with minimal disruption.\"A vaccine for horses and pigs is available in countries where the disease is endemic, but no JE vaccines for animals are registered for use in Australia, and there is no effective treatment for JE in animals.On Friday, Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria.This follows a confirmed human case of JEV in Queensland. Queensland Health said the confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.Less than 1 per cent of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.Goondiwindi and District Veterinary Services owner and vet Dr Trisha Pullos said the recent heavy rain in parts of Queensland and NSW had brought with it more mosquitoes and potentially more risk of JEV.\"We've had quite a bit of rain like everybody else, and the mozzies out here are brutal,\" Dr Pullos said.Dr Pullos said the main issues were observed in piglets - pigs didn't seem to be affected physically.\"If the piglets are born dead or weak or malformed or something really unusual or if the sow aborts the whole litter - that's the first sign,\" she said.\"Pigs can amplify the virus. It's not transferable between humans; it seems to be just the mosquitoes that are how we can catch it, so if you can keep the mozzies off you, then we'll be a little bit safer.\"She said it was important to get information from reliable sources and anyone who was worried should contact their vet.\"Anybody who's got two pigs in the backyard, or a pig for the kids, or a little kill herd at the back of the property - they need to contact their local vet and just say, 'Hey, I've got two pigs here. What do I need to keep an eye out for?'\"Then what we'll do is we'll let our district vet know who will then let the Chief Veterinary Officer know so we can try and track it a lot faster, because if someone goes and tells their neighbour but doesn't tell the vet then we're already behind the eight ball.\"She said there was a risk people had 'bad news fatigue' and wouldn't take things seriously.\"I've found that everyone's a little bit worn out. There's been quite a few comments on our Facebook posts where people are just like, 'Not again', or 'What now?' 'Can it just end?\"We might be at risk of going, 'Oh, whatever', and I want to make sure that they're not going to do that.\"JEV was detected in three people in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995. In 1998, two further cases were detected in people in Queensland, including one acquired on the Australian mainland.JEV is mostly transmitted by bites from infected mosquito vectors and is maintained in mosquito-waterbird or mosquito-waterbird-pig cycles.Waterbirds, particularly wading birds such as herons and egrets, are the main source from which transmission of JEV can occur. They are important amplifying hosts and hold enough virus in their blood to infect vectors for one to seven days.Pigs are also major amplifiers of the virus and develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect vectors for around four days.Horses and a wide range of other species may be infected but do not develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect mosquitoes, so are not involved in maintaining disease in an area.More newsWant daily news highlights delivered to your inbox?

  "main_text": "NSW records its first probable human case of Japanese encephalitisFollow our live blog for the latest on Russia's invasion of UkraineNSW has recorded its first probable human case of\u00a0Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).The person is a resident\u00a0in the NSW-Victoria border region and is in a stable condition in intensive care.Several more people in NSW\u00a0are undergoing further testing and more cases of the virus, which is spread by mosquitoes,\u00a0are expected to be confirmed in coming weeks.The virus has been declared an issue of national significance and NSW Health is warning the public to be vigilant and safeguard themselves against mosquito bites, as there is no specific treatment for JEV.Earlier today Queensland recorded its first human case of JEV \u2014 a woman in her 60s who is in a critical condition on life support after a camping trip in the south of the state.Japanese encephalitis is a rare virus that in serious cases can cause your brain to swell, with potentially fatal consequences.Her diagnosis follows the recent detection of Japanese encephalitis in\u00a0animal samples taken from a Goondiwindi commercial piggery\u00a0in the state's south.JEV can cause severe neurological illness, with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.The virus can infect animals as well as humans, and was recently confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in NSW, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria.Locally acquired cases of JEV have never previously been identified in NSW in animals or humans, as JEV is usually only found in far northern Australia and neighbouring countries.Mosquito-control activities are being carried out in the vicinity of farms where pigs are confirmed to have been infected by JEV, and NSW Health is arranging vaccinations for\u00a0workers on affected farms.The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products.NSW's Acting Chief Health Officer\u00a0Marianne Gale said the best way to avoid infection was to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are most active between dusk and dawn.\"NSW Health is cautioning people undertaking outdoor activities such as camping and fishing to carefully consider their plans,\" Dr Gale said.\"This is especially important for people planning activities near waterways or where mosquitoes are present, particularly the Murray River and its branches.\"People should be particularly vigilant given the recent wet weather conditions, which have led to very high mosquito numbers that may increase further in the coming days and weeks.\"NSW Health is working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and other state and territory agencies to determine the extent to which the virus is circulating, through animal testing and mosquito monitoring.Health authorities recommend these simple actions for avoiding mosquito bites:We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",

  "main_text": "by\n             Molly Walker, Deputy Managing Editor, MedPage Today                        \n        March 4, 2022Two service workers in Washington, D.C. contracted Seoul hantavirus in what is believed to be the first locally transmitted cases of the virus on U.S. soil.Both patients presented with several days of chills, high fever, headache, diarrhea, and vomiting. Both had acute kidney injury and responded to supportive treatment, and were later discharged.Rats seem to be the culprit in both cases, as Washington, D.C. has experienced increased calls to rodent control centers due to overpopulation, and Seoul hantavirus can be transmitted through aerosol exposure from rodent feces, saliva, or urine, noted Nivedita Ravi-Caldwell, DVM, of the CDC, and colleagues in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.They said that the first patient developed the first case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, \"a potentially fatal systemic inflammatory syndrome,\" related to hantavirus infection in the U.S., and only the second worldwide. The first was documented in China.\"Although extremely rare, the two ... cases ... highlight the importance of physicians including hantavirus infection in their differential diagnoses in patients with compatible symptoms and history of animal exposure or travel and underscore the importance of reporting notifiable infectious disease cases to health departments for investigation and response,\" the researchers wrote.The first patient, a 30-year-old man who worked in maintenance, presented in May 2018 to a Washington, D.C. healthcare facility with a 4-day history of symptoms, despite taking antipyretic medication. In addition to acute kidney injury over several days, he experienced hemoconcentration and thrombocytopenia. A week later, he had \"signs consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,\" including elevated levels of ferritin, triglycerides, and interleukin-2, as well as hemophagocytosis cells on a bone marrow biopsy.The second patient, a 37-year-old man who worked as a dishwasher and plumber's assistant, presented in November 2018 to a Washington, D.C. emergency department with a 3-day history of symptoms, including myalgia and productive cough. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of hepatic transaminases.Both patients had serology testing sent to CDC, showing hantavirus IgG and IgM titers that confirmed recent infection. Interestingly, Ravi-Caldwell's group noted that while the first patient had \"frequent rodent sightings\" at his workplace, the second was \"unaware of exposure to rodents at work, at home, or during his commute.\"The researchers explained that Norway rats can serve as reservoirs for Seoul hantavirus in the U.S., and \"previous cases of hantavirus infection have been linked to wild or pet rodents.\"Molly Walker is deputy managing editor and covers infectious diseases for MedPage Today.

  "headline": "RHODE ISLAND - Super-Contagious Avian Flu Seen As Threat To Rhode Island Poultry",
  "main_text": "PROVIDENCE \u2014 State environmental authorities are warning of a strain of flu lethal to poultry\u00a0that is expected to hit Rhode Island soon,\u00a0if it\u2019s not here already.No human cases of this type of avian influenza have been found in the United States, and it is not seen as a threat to people or to public health, but the virus is\u00a0deadly to chickens, ducks, turkeys and other farmed\u00a0and wild birds.\u201cIt is absolutely a concern\u00a0for all our membership,\u201d said Heidi Quinn, executive director of the Rhode Island Farm Bureau.\u00a0\u201cFrom our smallest to our biggest farms, it would affect them all. They have the potential to lose all their birds.\u201dThe virus\u00a0was first detected in South Carolina on Jan. 14 and in subsequent weeks has spread to the Midwest and the Northeast. Over the past three days, infected birds have been found in Connecticut and Massachusetts.More:Flu season arrives early in Rhode Island. Why and what to doThe virus has also been detected in wild waterfowl harvested by hunters along the Atlantic flyway, the migratory bird path that passes through Rhode Island.The last major outbreak of avian flu in the United States was in 2015, but Rhode Island state veterinarian Scott Marshall said the current occurrence of the virus is more worrying because of its geographic range.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine that we have the virus in the state,\u201d he said.Because mortality rates in infected flocks can be close to 100%, he and other officials with the state Department of Environmental Management\u00a0are monitoring poultry farms and urging owners to take steps to prevent infection.They include restricting access to farmed birds; ensuring they\u2019re kept away from wild birds, particularly migratory waterfowl; disinfecting cages, coops and clothes; not sharing equipment with other poultry producers; properly disposing of dead birds; and reporting sick birds or unusual bird deaths to the DEM.More:Special Good Night Lights tonight for military medical team that helped RI fight COVIDIf infected birds are found, they must be humanely killed to limit the spread of the virus, officials said. If no action is taken, all poultry across the state could be wiped out, they warned. Farmers would be eligible for federal relief if they have birds that must be killed.The DEM is reaching out to poultry farmers. The agency is\u00a0also working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to monitor for the virus, and with the state Department of Health and state Emergency Management Agency on emergency response plans.Under those plans, the DEM would respond quickly to reports of sick or dying poultry and obtain samples to be tested at nationally accredited labs. If a diagnosis is confirmed, the poultry on the affected farm will be killed within 24 hours. A control zone may also be established around the farm.Poultry owners across the region are being asked to voluntarily postpone through June any shows, exhibitions or\u00a0swap meets where birds are traded.They are also being asked to watch for signs of the disease in their birds, such as diarrhea, respiratory difficulty or neurological issues. Sudden death and in larger flocks, increased mortality rates, are of particular concern.\u201cThat should be a red flag and impetus for them to call us so we can go out and test,\u201d Marshall said.Members of the public wishing to\u00a0report sick or dying domestic birds should call (401) 222-2781.\u00a0If they fail to reach someone or if it\u2019s after regular business hours, call (401)\u00a0222-3070.\u00a0To report sick or dying wild birds, the number is (401) 789-0281.Although there is a risk for all poultry producers, it is lower for the biggest farmers in the state, such as Baffoni\u2019s Poultry Farm in Johnston or Little Rhody Farms in Johnston, which sells eggs, because they keep their birds under cover, said Quinn. For owners who keep their birds outdoors in mobile \u201cchicken tractors\u201d or backyard coops, the chances of interactions with infected wild birds are higher.Quinn said the most important thing is to get the word out so that poultry owners take steps to protect their flocks from the virus.\u201cEvery time it comes up, the hair stands up on the back of our necks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's super-contagious.\u201d",

  "main_text": "KSNT NewsPlease enter a search term.Please enter a search term.by: Matthew SelfPosted: Mar 4, 2022 / 05:23 PM CSTUpdated: Mar 4, 2022 / 05:49 PM CSTby: Matthew SelfPosted: Mar 4, 2022 / 05:23 PM CSTUpdated: Mar 4, 2022 / 05:49 PM CSTMANHATTAN (KSNT) \u2013 The Kansas Department of Agriculture is encouraging poultry owners to take additional steps to protect their flocks from avian influenza.This comes from the KDA\u2019s Division of Animal Health and concerns both commercial and backyard flocks. Owners are being told to monitor their birds for symptoms of avian influenza and by implementing biosecurity practices.Highly pathogenic avian influenza is an very contagious viral disease that can infect turkeys, chickens and other birds, causing severe illness and/or sudden death. HPAI has been found in backyard flocks as well as commercial operations in neighboring states but it has not been detected in the state of Kansas as of yet.\u201cProtecting the poultry in the state is a high priority, and we need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent the spread of disease in Kansas,\u201d Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said. \u201cOur best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness.\u201dTo best protect your poultry using biosecurity methods to prevent contamination, the KDA recommends:Symptoms of HPAI can include: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite\u2019 decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also bring about sudden death in birds even if they aren\u2019t showing other symptoms.If you see these symptoms in your birds, the KDA recommends that you reach out to your veterinarian immediately. Contact the KDA at 785-564-6601 if you don\u2019t have access to a veterinarian.The recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern according to the Centers for Disease Control. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been found in the U.S. Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk: poultry and eggs are safe for consumption when handled and cooked properly.According to the CDC, bird influenza rarely affects people. Humans can become infected when a bird sheds the virus in its saliva, mucous and/or feces. Humans are often infected when the virus gets into a person\u2019s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. When human infections are reported, the infections is usually limited, inefficient and not sustained.Federal and state partners are working together on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock as part of existing avian influenza response plans. The U.S. has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world according to the KDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.For more information on HPAI, go to the KDA\u2019s avian influenza webpage here or call 785-564-6601.Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc.

The Fulton County case involved 246,000 chickens.Kentucky, to date has had two cases of HPAI. The other case involved a commercial turkey flock in Webster County. Other confirmed cases of HPAI in the United States include four commercial turkey flocks in Dubois County, Indiana, two commercial turkey flocks in Greene County, Indiana, and a commercial layer flock in New Castle County, Delaware.The presence of HPAI in a commercial turkey flock in Nova Scotia, Canada, was also confirmed earlier in 2022.To date, HPAI has been confirmed in three of the four flyways. Missouri, Indiana and Kentucky are in the Mississippi Flyway, while Delaware and Nova Scotia are located in the Atlantic Flyway. While no HPAI cases have been confirmed in commercial poultry in the Pacific Flyway, it has been confirmed in a bald eagle found in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

  "main_text": "A new report issued today by the UK Health Security Agency has revealed that there has been considerable progress in eliminating hepatitis C as a public health problem in England, with deaths from the virus falling by 35% between 2015 and 2020.\u00a0 The number of people with chronic hepatitis C has also declined to approximately 81,000 in 2020 (compared to 129,000 in 2015) \u2013 a 37% fall in the general population.Pamela Healy, Chief Executive of the British Liver Trust said, \u201cThere is now an effective cure for everyone living with hepatitis C and the significant decline in deaths and cases is encouraging.\u201cThe challenge now is for us to find the thousands who are currently undiagnosed. Our message is if you have ever dabbled with drugs (even when you were much younger), practiced unsafe sex or had a tattoo while travelling abroad please get yourself tested just to make sure \u2013 the virus has no symptoms in the early stages.\u201cJust as importantly, if we are to meet the World Health Organisations target of elimination by 2030, we\u00a0need urgent action to tackle the drug problem in the UK so that new people do not become infected.\u201dModelling indicates that, of the 81,000 people estimated to have this chronic infection in England, around:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a bloodborne virus that can cause life-threatening liver disease, including cancer. \u00a0However, those infected often have no symptoms until many years later when their liver has been badly damaged. \u00a0When symptoms do occur, they can often be non-specific, like tiredness or loss of appetite, and be dismissed or mistaken for other conditions.Andrew, 47 years old, a former hepatitis C patient based in Scotland: \u201cI was surprised to learn that I had hepatitis C.\u00a0 I got tested a couple of times before and was negative. I learned about it by chance.\u00a0 I was in the hospital on an unrelated matter and got blood taken, and my liver results were a bit abnormal.\u00a0 I got my drugs worker to test me and I found out that I was positive for hepatitis C.\u00a0 I was devastated.\u00a0 I even thought that I was going to die.\u00a0 Luckily, the modern treatment is superb.\u201cI started my course of tablets immediately after learning that I\u2019d got hepatitis C, and when I got tested again in 12 weeks, to my relief, I\u2019d been cured.\u00a0 To anyone in a similar situation, get tested. Do it to get that piece of mind for yourself.\u201dDr Helen Harris, Clinical Scientist at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \u201cIn England, we are on our way to eliminating hepatitis C as the number of deaths continue to decline, and direct acting antiviral drugs are available that will clear the virus in around 95% of people who complete treatment.\u201cBut many people remain undiagnosed, often because they have no symptoms or are unaware that they have ever been at risk. \u00a0If you have ever injected drugs \u2013 even if it happened only once or years ago \u2013 you could be at risk of hepatitis C. \u00a0If you think you could be at risk, speak to your GP and get a free test.\u201dRead the full report here:\u00a0https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-c-in-the-ukYou can also find out if you are at risk by taking online quiz -\u00a0 visit www.britishlivertrust.org.uk/screener.\u201dTweets by LiverTrustBritish Liver Trust\nVenta Court\n20 Jewry Street\nWinchester\nSO23 8FEThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

  "main_text": "An urgent public health alert has been issued after the first human case of a serious mosquito-borne virus was detected in Queensland.A public health alert has been issued following the first confirmed human case of a rare mosquito-borne virus in Queensland.The person recently travelled throughout southern Queensland and is being treated in a Brisbane hospital.The Japanese Encephalitis Virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals.In animals, it mostly occurs in pigs and horses.Clinicians at Queensland hospitals have been urged to watch out for the virus in people presenting with brain swelling or similar symptoms.Most human infections cause no symptoms or mild ones such as headache or fever.But a person with severe disease may present with inflammation of the brain, characterised by sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and chills, severe headache, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness and nausea or vomiting.Children aged under five and older people are at a higher risk of developing more severe illness.\u201cWe encourage Queenslanders to take necessary steps to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes, especially given the recent flooding event which may lead to an increase in mosquito numbers in coming weeks,\u201d Queensland Health said in a statement on Thursday night.The human case follows a detection at a piggery in southern Queensland last week.There have also been detections in NSW, Victoria and South Australia.\u201cThere is no risk to humans from consuming pork or pig products. Pork products are safe to eat,\u201d Queensland Health said.\u201cThe virus cannot be spread directly from person to person.\u201dQueensland Health is working with the Department of Agriculture as well as state, territory and federal agencies to discuss a national response.Support is also being provided to intensive livestock industry workers.Further south, NSW officials are responding to an outbreak in animals of the mosquito-borne disease, which has never been seen in southern Australia before.Officials realised last week Japanese Encephalitis was spreading in piggeries in the state\u2019s south after agriculture businesses noticed an increase in stillborn piglets.The disease has been detected in six piggeries in NSW, one in Victoria and one in Queensland.Four human cases have been detected in Victoria.People have been warned to avoid being bit by mosquitoes and there are concerns the insects will spike in numbers due to the ongoing flooding crisis.NSW health secretary Elizabeth Koff told a budget estimates hearing on Thursday officials were focused on preventing Japanese encephalitis from spreading to people.Though most people who get infected experience no symptoms, children are vulnerable and on rare occasions get seriously ill.Symptoms include fever, joint pain and rashes and in severe cases patients have suffered from neurological illness with headaches, convulsions and loss of consciousness.\u201cIt\u2019s most concerning in the under-five age group,\u201d Ms Koff said.She added NSW had secured \u201cplentiful supplies\u201d of vaccines that can protect against the disease.In a warning issued last weekend, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said people should take care to protect themselves against mosquito bites.\u201cIt is really important to protect yourself from mosquito bites as mosquitoes can spread viruses including Japanese encephalitis,\u201d she said.The current Japanese encephalitis outbreak is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, according to Australian Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp.\u201cBiosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure,\u201d he said earlier in the week.The wet summer has provided good breeding conditions for mosquitoes and stagnant pools of water left by the ongoing floods on the east coast could lead to an even bigger increase.\u201cMosquitoes carry multiple and potentially dangerous illnesses, and people in rain-affected areas are particularly vulnerable right now given these conditions are ripe for mosquito activity,\u201d Queensland Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said earlier in the week.\u201cSome of the most common mosquito-borne illnesses are Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus and malaria, though these are only some of what can be spread by a mosquito bite.\u201cTwo people, including one aged in their 20s, died overnight as they waited for paramedics to help them, a union claims.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says a fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will be needed to protect people from the virus.Victorians who work in casual or other insecure jobs will no longer be forced to choose between a day\u2019s pay and looking after their health.Our Apps",

  "main_text": "ATLANTA, GA \u2014 A 5-year-old boy in Georgia and a 53-year-old woman in Kansas died from a rare tropical disease \u2014 typically found in South Asia \u2014 that was linked to an imported aromatherapy spray product sold at Walmart stores.That's according to new details published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, which outlined four cases of melioidosis in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and Texas, that were linked to bottles of room sprays from Better Homes and Gardens. The bottles were labeled as a \"highly fragranced essential oil and semi-precious stone infused room spray\" with a \"lavender and chamomile\" scent.And now, the authors say health care professionals should more closely consider melioidosis in patients showing similar symptoms, even if they haven't traveled to places where the disease is endemic.As Patch previously reported, Walmart recalled about 3,900 bottles of \"Better Homes and Gardens Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones.\" The aromatherapy room spray was sold at 55 Walmart stores and online from February 2021 through October 2021 for about $4.One bottle of the essential oil sprays was found to contain Burkholderia pseudomallei, a dangerous bacteria that lives in soil and water and causes the melioidosis infection when ingested, breathed or absorbed through the skin.The infection, also called Whitmore's disease, can lead to skin abscesses in the absence of fever, pneumonia, sepsis, organ abscesses, genital infection, and inflamed brain or spinal cord.Most melioidosis cases are reported in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Northern Australia, as well as several other South Asia countries, though there have been cases reported in Puerto Rico, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Central and South America, and parts of Africa and the Middle East, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But in America, cases are exceedingly rare. About a dozen are reported to the CDC each year, and the vast majority are linked to travel to areas where melioidosis is endemic. So experts were puzzled when two people in America died from the bacteria, and none of the four in the cluster of cases \u2014 which occurred over a period of just a few months \u2014 had traveled internationally.After testing numerous items the four patients were exposed to, researchers connected the strain of bacteria to an aromatherapy spray bottle that was imported from India.All four patients were hospitalized early during their clinical course, the researchers said.Initial tests did not reveal a bacterial infection.Kansas CaseIn the first case, a 53-year-old woman went to an emergency room March 13 in Kansas. The woman fell ill with shortness of breath, cough, malaise and weakness. She also had an extensive past of medical issues, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, cirrhosis due to hepatitis C, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, psoriatic arthritis and drug and alcohol abuse.She was given antibiotics for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection, the researchers said, as steroids for the COPD. But her condition deteriorated to the point where she was moved to an intensive care unit on day four and given a wider array of antibiotics. Two days later, she developed septic shock and had to be placed on a ventilator. She died on her ninth day in the hospital. A post-death examination was not performed, the researchers said.Texas CaseTwo months later, a 4-year-old girl in Texas fell ill.She visited a doctor May 31 after three days with a fever, decreased activity, loss of appetite and a day of vomiting.The girl had no significant medical history and hadn't traveled out of the country. After an unremarkable exam, she was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis.Two days later, she was taken to an urgent care clinic because the fever continued, now at 103 degrees. She was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection after a test of her urine, and was sent home with a penicillin-type antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.The girl's condition initially improved, but she returned to the emergency department two days later with intermittent fevers, vomiting and progressive lethargy. She had a fever of nearly 101 degrees and was tachycardic and tachypneic, meaning her heart was beating abnormally fast and her breathing was atypically rapid. Additionally, her white-cell count was 16,000 per cubic millimeter, lower than the 17,7000 she had just two days earlier.The girl tested positive for human rhinovirus and enterovirus, and she was admitted into a children's ICU. She was diagnosed with septic shock and meningoencephalitis, or serious inflammation of the brain and membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord.She received ceftriaxone, an anti-bacterial medication, and had to be intubated due to falling blood-oxygen levels. She was also given anti-inflammatory drugs. But her breathing and neurologic conditions continued to decline while in the ICU, and she had to receive broader antibiotics. She was eventually diagnosed with melioidosis after a blood culture grew the bacteria, which was initially misidentified. She received drug treatments for eight weeks, followed by months of eradication therapy.\"Three months after discharge, the patient remained wheelchair-bound and nonverbal,\" the researchers saidAlso in late May, a 53-year-old man was rushed to a Minnesota emergency room after family members found him weak and in an altered mental state.The man had a history of medical issues, including a dependence on alcohol and tobacco. He, too, hadn't traveled internationally.An MRI of his brain showed his condition was consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. The neurological disease is often characterized by confusion, an inability to coordinate voluntary movement and eye abnormalities. He was admitted to a hospital for treatment of acute metabolic encephalopathy. The man experienced hip pain while in the hospital, and additional MRI images showed some degeneration changes.After six days in the hospital, he was discharged to a transitional care facility.But on June 6, just eight days after his initial emergency room visit, the man was moved back to the ER with a 104-degree fever and deteriorating mental state. His oxygen saturation had fallen to 90 percent.He was given medication after chest scans showed evidence of pneumonia. Those meds were later switched to However, meropenem was later switched to antibiotics after he developed a new rash. The man's fever waned, and he was weaned off oxygen.On day six, the fever returned and the pain in his right hip worsened. An MRI showed acute inflammation, including myositis \u2014 a rare disease characterized by inflamed muscles that can cause muscle fatigue and weakness \u2014 a possibly septic hip and inflammation in his right pelvic bone.As in other cases, blood cultures initially misidentified the bacteria. The Burkholderia pseudomallei was later identified on blood cultures and from a sample of his right hip joint. The patient was discharged to a transitional care facility June 23. He completed eight weeks of intravenous drugs and was given a schedule for eradication therapy. But even after discharge, he remained confused, researchers said, and showed evidence of osteonecrosis of the infected hip joint. In the disease, a lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can replenish new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.In Georgia, a 5-year-old boy was taken to the emergency room July 12 after three days of weakness, fever, tongue swelling, sore throat, nausea and vomiting.Similar to the girl in Texas, he did not have a history of major medical issues. And like the other three cases, he hadn't traveled outside the country.The boy had a fever of about 102 degrees and also had a an abnormally rapid heart beat, as well as intermittent periods of atypically rapid breathing. He also had an elevated white-cell count. Tests showed he was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, more commonly known as the coronavirus. The virus causes the COVID-19 disease.The boy was admitted to the hospital for observation and rehydration. But his oxygen saturation levels fell overnight, and he was moved to an ICU due to concerns of imminent breathing failure. After chest images later showed opacities and fluid in his lungs, the boy was given remdesivir and dexamethasone, common treatments for COVID-19. He as also given anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial drugs, and later an antibiotic used to treat certain serious bacterial infections.But the boy's fever persisted and his breathing continued to deteriorate. On the third day in the hospital, his right arm fell weak. A day later, his pupils became dilated and nonreactive. A CT scan showed a large cerebral infarct. Also called ischemic stroke, the infarction happens when there's disrupted blood flow to the brain, and can cause parts of the brain to die off.The boy's heart and lungs progressively deteriorated despite efforts to resuscitate him. He was left in a vegetative state and died on his fourth day in the hospital.Tests performed during his autopsy showed the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei in his lungs, liver, spleen and brain, as well as COVID-19 in his lungs.Melioidosis was detected in all four patients, who each fell severely ill and who hadn't traveled to places where melioidosis was endemic. However, melioidosis might not have been initially considered because the four had not traveled to areas where the disease is endemic. Additionally, initial tests didn't uncover a Burkholderia pseudomallei infection.Furthermore, the patients in Kansas, Texas and Georgia all received glucocorticoid therapy prior to being diagnosed with melioidosis, which could have contributed to the severity of disease, researchers said.The Georgia boy's coronavirus infection also likely contributed to the severity of his illness. In a previous case, the CDC found that the coronavirus may have reactivated a previous fatal coinfection of Covid-19 and melioidosis in which the SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have reactivated a latent Burkholderia pseudomallei infection.In discussing the four cases, the researchers highlighted the risks associated with exposure to imported products from areas where the bacterium is endemic.\"Health care providers should consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a history of travel to melioidosis-endemic areas,\" the study said. \"In addition, patients who have acute respiratory or neurologic symptoms that do not have a response to initial treatment may be candidates for closer assessment for melioidosis.\"",

She received drug treatments for eight weeks, followed by months of eradication therapy.\"Three months after discharge, the patient remained wheelchair-bound and nonverbal,\" the researchers saidAlso in late May, a 53-year-old man was rushed to a Minnesota emergency room after family members found him weak and in an altered mental state.The man had a history of medical issues, including a dependence on alcohol and tobacco. He, too, hadn't traveled internationally.An MRI of his brain showed his condition was consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. The neurological disease is often characterized by confusion, an inability to coordinate voluntary movement and eye abnormalities. He was admitted to a hospital for treatment of acute metabolic encephalopathy. The man experienced hip pain while in the hospital, and additional MRI images showed some degeneration changes.After six days in the hospital, he was discharged to a transitional care facility.But on June 6, just eight days after his initial emergency room visit, the man was moved back to the ER with a 104-degree fever and deteriorating mental state. His oxygen saturation had fallen to 90 percent.He was given medication after chest scans showed evidence of pneumonia. Those meds were later switched to However, meropenem was later switched to antibiotics after he developed a new rash. The man's fever waned, and he was weaned off oxygen.On day six, the fever returned and the pain in his right hip worsened. An MRI showed acute inflammation, including myositis \u2014 a rare disease characterized by inflamed muscles that can cause muscle fatigue and weakness \u2014 a possibly septic hip and inflammation in his right pelvic bone.As in other cases, blood cultures initially misidentified the bacteria. The Burkholderia pseudomallei was later identified on blood cultures and from a sample of his right hip joint. The patient was discharged to a transitional care facility June 23. He completed eight weeks of intravenous drugs and was given a schedule for eradication therapy. But even after discharge, he remained confused, researchers said, and showed evidence of osteonecrosis of the infected hip joint. In the disease, a lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can replenish new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.In Georgia, a 5-year-old boy was taken to the emergency room July 12 after three days of weakness, fever, tongue swelling, sore throat, nausea and vomiting.Similar to the girl in Texas, he did not have a history of major medical issues. And like the other three cases, he hadn't traveled outside the country.The boy had a fever of about 102 degrees and also had a an abnormally rapid heart beat, as well as intermittent periods of atypically rapid breathing. He also had an elevated white-cell count. Tests showed he was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, more commonly known as the coronavirus. The virus causes the COVID-19 disease.The boy was admitted to the hospital for observation and rehydration. But his oxygen saturation levels fell overnight, and he was moved to an ICU due to concerns of imminent breathing failure. After chest images later showed opacities and fluid in his lungs, the boy was given remdesivir and dexamethasone, common treatments for COVID-19. He as also given anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial drugs, and later an antibiotic used to treat certain serious bacterial infections.But the boy's fever persisted and his breathing continued to deteriorate. On the third day in the hospital, his right arm fell weak. A day later, his pupils became dilated and nonreactive. A CT scan showed a large cerebral infarct. Also called ischemic stroke, the infarction happens when there's disrupted blood flow to the brain, and can cause parts of the brain to die off.The boy's heart and lungs progressively deteriorated despite efforts to resuscitate him. He was left in a vegetative state and died on his fourth day in the hospital.Tests performed during his autopsy showed the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei in his lungs, liver, spleen and brain, as well as COVID-19 in his lungs.Melioidosis was detected in all four patients, who each fell severely ill and who hadn't traveled to places where melioidosis was endemic. However, melioidosis might not have been initially considered because the four had not traveled to areas where the disease is endemic. Additionally, initial tests didn't uncover a Burkholderia pseudomallei infection.Furthermore, the patients in Kansas, Texas and Georgia all received glucocorticoid therapy prior to being diagnosed with melioidosis, which could have contributed to the severity of disease, researchers said.The Georgia boy's coronavirus infection also likely contributed to the severity of his illness. In a previous case, the CDC found that the coronavirus may have reactivated a previous fatal coinfection of Covid-19 and melioidosis in which the SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have reactivated a latent Burkholderia pseudomallei infection.In discussing the four cases, the researchers highlighted the risks associated with exposure to imported products from areas where the bacterium is endemic.\"Health care providers should consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a history of travel to melioidosis-endemic areas,\" the study said. \"In addition, patients who have acute respiratory or neurologic symptoms that do not have a response to initial treatment may be candidates for closer assessment for melioidosis.\"",

Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through contact with the body fluids of an infected person.In some cases, Lassa fever has similar symptoms to malaria, appearing between one and three weeks after exposure to the virus. In mild cases, the disease causes fever, fatigue, weakness, and headache.As part of measures to contain the outbreak among medical workers, the NMA said it had directed the frontline doctors and other health workers to wear appropriate personal protective equipment at all times.On Saturday, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) said the death toll of Lassa fever in the most populous African country had risen to 86 as of Feb. 21.The NCDC said 74 out of the country's 774 local government areas have been affected by this hemorrhagic fever since January.The case fatality rate in the country so far this year has reached 19.1 percent, the NCDC said.The NCDC said it is distributing medical response commodities to states and treatment centers, as part of measures to control the spread.Nigeria has activated the national multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary Lassa fever emergency operations center in response to the outbreak since late January.  \u25a0",

State officials quarantined the site, which is in Pottawattamie County on the Iowa-Nebraska border, said the USDA. The infected mixed-species flock of 42 birds would be destroyed, it said.Iowa, which produces\u00a0one of every seven eggs\u00a0in the country, was the state hit hardest by the bird flu epidemic of 2014 and 2015, with losses of more than 31.5 million turkeys and egg-laying hens. In neighboring Minnesota, the top turkey-growing state, 9 million birds were killed by the virus or culled in attempts to stop its spread.Overall,\u00a050 million birds, mostly hens and turkeys, died in the 2014-15 epidemic, which drove up egg prices in the grocery store and caused economic losses of more than $1 billion.More than 1.6 million birds, mostly chickens, have died in this year\u2019s outbreaks, which began in early February and were the first incidents of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks in two years. The\u00a0Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\u00a0has listed 17 cases in nine states: Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New York, and Virginia.Indiana has had the largest number of outbreaks \u2014 five confirmed and one pending \u2014 while Delaware has had the largest loss: 12 million birds on a poultry farm in New Castle County. Iowa and Connecticut have the newest confirmed outbreaks. The Connecticut case involved a mixed-species backyard flock of 100 birds in New London County, in the southeastern corner of the state.HPAI can be spread by migratory waterfowl and their droppings; it can also be spread from barn to barn by workers and contaminated equipment. \u201cThe best way to protect your birds is to follow good biosecurity,\u201d with such steps as restricting access to flocks and cleaning clothes, vehicles, and equipment used around flocks, said a\u00a0USDA fact sheet.\u201cWe have been working with USDA, livestock producers, and other stakeholders to develop, test, and strengthen our foreign animal disease preparedness and response plans since the 2015 HPAI outbreak,\u201d said Naig. \u201cWhile a case like this is not unexpected, we are working with USDA and other partners to implement our plans and protect the health of poultry flocks in Iowa.\u201d\u00a9 2022 Meredith Corporation.

The OIE report was issued on March 2.While this case does not involve commercial poultry and should not result in any poultry trade barriers, it does mark the first case of HPAI in the Pacific Flyway.Previously, the only case of HPAI in Canadian poultry was in a commercial turkey flock in Nova Scotia. It was also detected in wild birds and backyard birds in Nova Scotia, as well as in Newfoundland and Labrador. The most recent OIE report also revealed the presence of HPAI in an eagle in Prince Edward Island. All of those discoveries were in the Atlantic Flyway. The first case of HPAI in Canada this winter was confirmed at an exhibition farm in Newfoundland and Labrador.HPAI has also been detected in eight commercial poultry flocks in the United States, specifically in the states of Indiana (5), Kentucky (2) and Delaware (1). Of those eight flocks, six were turkey flocks, while one was a broiler flock and the other was a layer flock. HPAI has also been confirmed in wild birds and backyard flocks in some other states in the Atlantic and Mississippi flyways, which like the Vancouver case, is not a cause for any trade bans.\u201cThe finding from British Columbia is likely a separate introduction from that in the Atlantic provinces,\u201d the OIE stated in its report.Wildlife surveillance as well as the Canadian Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) activities for poultry are ongoing in Canada.In addition to North America, there have also been confirmed cases of HPAI in the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa.View our continuing coverage of the\u00a0global avian influenza situation.Roy Graber is a senior reporter at WATT Global Media.

(WHNT) \u2014 The U.S. Department (USDA) of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed a wild duck in Limestone County was found to have Avian Influenza (HPAI).The USDA says the disease was discovered in a wild, hunter-harvested American wigeon.According to the APHIS, cases of \u201cEurasian H5 HPAI\u201d were found in South Carolina in January 2022, and have since been found in 14 additional states.Seth Maddox with the Alabama Department of Conservation  said the Eurasian H5 Avian Influenza has reached at least 14 other states counting last month\u2019s detection.\u201c(During) the spring months the temperature starts to warm up and it will kill that virus,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cAnd our waterfowl are migrating back up north as we speak. So a lot of those birds that are carriers of it are getting out and going back up north. So we hope we don\u2019t get any more.\u201d\u201cChickens and turkeys mainly, it\u2019s definitely a death sentence if one of those houses get infected,\u201d Maddox said.Maddox adds it could mean a serious risk for Alabama\u2019s poultry industry, putting state wildlife experts and the U.S. Department of Agriculture on alert.\u201cThere\u2019s high economic impact that could come from this, and it\u2019s bad for wildlife too, especially bird species,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cSo there\u2019s high concern with this. As of now we\u2019re still monitoring it very closely to see the ramifications of it.\u201dMaddox also stresses if you do come across birds that seem disoriented or lifeless on the ground, don\u2019t touch them. Instead, contact DCNR as soon as possible. If you live in Tennessee an operator can still connect you with proper authorities, Maddox said.What to know about the virus:The USDA states that the HPAI H5 viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds, spreads rapidly, and have potentially high mortality in infected poultry.Can humans get infected?According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, \u201cThe risk to humans from Eurasian H5 HPAI is low.\u201d The CDC says there has not been a reported case of Eurasian H5 HPAI in humans in the U.S.Anyone wanting more information about the risk of the avian flu spreading to humans can visit the CDC\u2019s website here.How was the virus found in Limestone County?The USDA says samples were collected for testing from the duck in Limestone County during routine monitoring for the disease. Initial tests were positive for Eurasian H5 HPAI, and additional tests by the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa confirmed the positive results.Should hunters be cautious?According to the USDA, hunters should minimize direct contact with any wild birds by wearing gloves. Of course, handwashing with soap and warm water is encouraged if direct contact occurs. They also advise changing your clothes before coming into contact with healthy domestic poultry and birds.Wild birds can be infected with avian influenza without appearing sick.How can I report a bird I think is infected?The public is encouraged to report dead or dying bird sightings to the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) for collection and testing. You can report a sighting by calling ADCNR\u2019s Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division at (334) 242-3469. Officials say it is important to avoid contact with any dead or dying bird.For information regarding HPAI and domestic poultry, contact the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries at (800) 642-7761.Submit\u0394document.getElementById( \"ak_js_1\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() );Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc.

It is easily transmitted through contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces.The increase in reported outbreaks was initially in educational settings, particularly in nursery and childcare facilities, with 48% more incidents reported to\u00a0UKHSA\u00a0than would be expected.Reports of norovirus outbreaks in care home settings to\u00a0UKHSA\u00a0have also increased in recent weeks in 2022 \u2013 with a rise from 24 reported in week 6 (week commencing 7 February), to 40 reported in week 7 (week commencing 14 February).While outbreaks reported in care home settings overall remain below pre-pandemic expected levels, it is likely they will continue to increase in the coming weeks and a rise in norovirus outbreaks in care home settings often precedes an increase in outbreaks in hospital settings. Therefore, it is important to take steps to limit the spread of norovirus.Professor Saheer Gharbia, Gastrointestinal Pathogens and Food Safety Directorate,\u00a0UKHSA, said:Norovirus, commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, has been at lower levels than normal throughout the pandemic but as people have begun to mix more, the numbers of outbreaks have started to increase again.Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do not return to work or send children to school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared.Please avoid visiting elderly relatives if you are unwell \u2013 particularly if they are in a care home or hospital. As with COVID-19 and other infectious illnesses, hand washing is really important to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, unlike for COVID-19 alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus so soap and water is best.Subscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTubeHow to reduce the spread of norovirusNorovirus activity has risen as people have begun to mix more \u2013 it is possible that unusual or out-of-season increases could be seen in the coming months.Your email address will not be published.

To date there have been no confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis in horses in Australia.\u201cHorse owners are encouraged to reduce mosquito breeding grounds near their horses to reduce the chances of them being bitten,\u201d Dr Cooke said.\u201cStabling at night, the use of a light cotton rug and fly mask and application of a safe insect repellent may also help.\u201dJapanese encephalitis is a notifiable disease under the Livestock Disease Control Act.Dr Cooke encouraged animal owners to report any cases of unexplained pig deaths, especially piglets, or unexplained horse illnesses, to the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888, to their local vet or to Agriculture Victoria animal health staff.For more information, visit: agriculture.vic.gov.au/biosecurity/animal-diseases/horse-diseases/japanese-encephalitis-virus-jevDelivered weekly each Wednesday\u00a9 McPherson Media Group 2021",

But it turns out that it is more widespread in our country than previously thought, and all this thanks to a transmitting agent: the tick.A recent study of National Center for Microbiology confirms that the Crimean Congo virus has been detected in five autonomous communities.The first reported case in Spain dates from 2013, but there is very little data.  On 2016the virus was identified in one patient and in the nurse who had treated him.After the analysis of 12,000 ticksthe Crimea Congo has been detected in Andalusia, Extremadura, Madrid, Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Castilla-La Mancha. Ticks from Murcia have also been studied, without positive results, although their existence cannot be ruled out.The symptom of this disease begin suddenly, in the form of fever, muscle pain, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, lumbago, headache, eye irritation and photophobia.  There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal and throat pain at first, followed by mood swings and confusion.",

The disease is not transmitted from person to person and cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products.Australia\u2019s health department confirmed the disease had been found in one piggery in Victoria\u2019s north, six piggeries in NSW and one in Queensland.\u201cThis is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, and biosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure,\u201d Australian chief veterinary officer Dr Mark Schipp said.Federal, state and territory authorities are meeting regularly to \u201cwork through the next steps of this situation\u201d.Anyone who works with pigs or horses, even if they\u2019re backyard pets, is urged to keep an eye out and report any possible signs of the disease.Australia\u2019s acting chief medical officer Sonya Bennett said two vaccinations were available for protection against JEV in Australia.Older people and those aged under five who are infected have a higher risk of developing a serious illness.\u201cEncephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of JEV infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting,\u201d she said.Dr Bennett said anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek urgent medical attention.She encouraged people to avoid exposure to infected mosquitoes, with those in high mosquito areas encouraged to use repellent and cover up with loose-fitting clothing.-with AAPGet The New Daily free every morning and evening.Follow The New DailyCopyright \u00a9 2022 The New Daily.

  "main_text": "Another commercial poultry flock in southern Indiana has tested positive for avian influenza, according to state officials.A laboratory test for the virus was carried out on a fourth commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana and the result came back positive.According to\u00a0Phys.org, the samples were tested at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture in Iowa.Dubois County had three cases, and Greene County had two. A zoo and a backyard flock have also been found to have been infected. Preliminary tests are expected to reveal whether or not this strain of the virus is particularly pathogenic.More than 16,000 birds have been slaughtered in an effort to stop the spread of the virus to other farms.Also Read:\u00a029,000 Turkeys Killed to Prevent a Highly Pathogenic Strain of Bird Flu in the U.S.According to the report, workers from the Animal Health Board went out to known backyard poultry owners in the area to arrange for bird testing to take place there.Currently, no human instances of avian influenza viruses have been found in the United States, according to the\u00a0CDC. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed the first case of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020.The Animal Health Board reported that more than 400,000 birds died as a result of a bird flu outbreak in Dubois County in January 2016. In terms of turkey production, Indiana ranks third in the United States.On the basis of their molecular properties and their potential to cause disease and death in chickens in a laboratory setting, Avian Influenza A viruses has two categories - low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).In low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), chickens/poultry may show no symptoms or a moderate illness (like ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production).Infected wild birds with low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses show no or few symptoms of illness. Some LPAI A viruses can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses in poultry infected with them.The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) can cause severe\u00a0sickness\u00a0and substantial mortality in poultry infected with the virus. Chickens can die from HPAI A virus infections within 48 hours, with mortality rates of up to 90% and 100%, depending on the severity of the sickness.Some ducks, however, may be affected even if they show no symptoms of sickness. HPAI A viral infection in poultry can potentially transmit to wild birds, allowing the virus to spread even further.Some HPAI A virus subtypes can infect some wild bird species without causing any symptoms, while other HPAI A virus subtypes can cause severe sickness and death in some wild birds and livestock.Related Article:\u00a0US Farms Placed on Quarantine Due to Increased Cases of Bird FluFor more news, updates about bird flu and similar topics don't forget to follow Nature World News!Tags\nbird flu outbreak, Turkey Farm, Indiana\u00a9 2022 NatureWorldNews.com All rights reserved.

Therefore, it is safe to continue to consume poultry products as long as they are cooked properly to kill bacteria. In a press release, the Iowa Dept. of Agriculture stressed that there is \"no immediate public health concern\" and there are no cases of humans who have contracted the virus in the US.\"We recognize the threat HPAI and other foreign animal diseases pose to Iowa agriculture,\u201d said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig in the press release. \u201cWe have been working with USDA, livestock producers and other stakeholders to develop, test and strengthen our foreign animal disease preparedness and response plans since the 2015 HPAI outbreak. While a case like this is not unexpected, we are working with USDA and other partners to implement our plans and protect the health of poultry flocks in Iowa.\u201dThe 2015 outbreak was considered one of the most serious animal health disease incidents to ever occur in the US, affecting 50.4 million birds and 211 flocks along with backyard flocks in a seven-month period from Dec. 2014 to June 2015. Losses of an estimated $1 billion were suffered, and the USDA created a response plan called The Red Book, which provides a detailed strategy to manage avian influenza outbreaks. Iowa was one of the hardest-hit states with tens of millions of commercial turkeys and chickens infected.The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship worked with the USDA and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to confirm the case of HPAI, a virus that is often fatal to domestic bird populations such as chicken and turkeys.Anyone who owns domestic bird flocks should contact their veterinarian if they observe or suspect signs of HPAI in their birds, including but not limited to sudden bird deaths, degraded egg quality and production, difficulty breathing or runny nose and swelling or discoloration in key features. Veterinarians are legally required to report clinical signs of avian influenza to the Iowa State Veterinarian because it qualifies as a reportable animal disease.HPAI is spread through bird \"droppings or nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil,\" and the Dept. of Agriculture and Stewardship recommends that flock owners should practice good biosecurity and prevent contact between domestic and wild birds, especially as wild birds may not show signs of the virus and the low pathogenic avian influenza can develop into the high pathogenic form.Download our apps today for all of our latest coverage.Get the latest news and weather delivered straight to your inbox.",

  "main_text": "A dangerous strain of bird flu, highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been found in a backyard flock in New London County, according to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture.This comes after highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, was found in wild ducks -- mallards -- in Connecticut and the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued a warning for people who have chickens or other game birds to report anything out of the ordinary.State officials said no human cases of this particular strain of avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States and that, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recent detections of this strain of influenza in birds in Connecticut and several other states present a low risk to the public.They said proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills bacteria and viruses.Connecticut State Veterinarian Dr. Jane Lewis said in a news release that samples were sent to the Connecticut Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab for testing and were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.State officials said birds from the flock will not enter the food system and, according to USDA guidance, a surveillance zone has been set up around the property to monitor area flocks.Anyone involved in poultry production is urged to increase measures to prevent their flocks from becoming infected and they are urged to review biosecurity plans and take precautions to protect their birds.After hauling birds to processors, clean and disinfect poultry transport coops and vehicles before they return to the farm.Poultry owners are also urged to keep their birds away from wild ducks and geese and their droppings and outdoor access for poultry should be limited at this time.You can check online here to see where wild birds with the disease have been found.Report anything unusual, especially sick or dead birds, to CT DoAg at 860-713-2505 or ctstate.vet@ct.gov.",

  "main_text": "by\n             Crystal Phend, Contributing Editor, MedPage Today                        \n        March 2, 2022While the lavender-scented spritz from Walmart might have seemed the furthest thing from exotic, the Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria inside sparked a deadly melioidosis outbreak that CDC scientists highlighted as a reason to watch for unexpected infections.\"Health care providers should consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a history of travel to melioidosis-endemic areas,\" Jay E. Gee, PhD, of the CDC's Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch in Atlanta, and colleagues reported in a brief report in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).The bacterium, typically associated with travel to tropical and subtropical areas like Thailand and Malaysia, where it's endemic in soil and water, was a mystery when it showed up in four patients in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas in 2021.None of the four (two children ages 4 and 5, two adults both age 53) were related or had such a travel history, perhaps not surprising during the pandemic.Initial presentation ranged from cough and shortness of breath, to weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, intermittent fever, and rash on the trunk, abdomen, and face, later diagnosed as meningoencephalitis.The CDC knew there was a potentially common source of exposure based on genomic analysis of the initial case, a woman who showed up in the emergency department on March 13, 2021, with cough, shortness of breath, malaise, and weakness. She had a number of comorbid conditions, notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis from hepatitis C, substance abuse, and psoriatic arthritis.After starting on empirical antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia and a urinary tract infection, she got glucocorticoids for COPD exacerbation. Her condition deteriorated despite escalating antibiotics over the next several days and she died in the ICU on day 9.The next two cases occurred in May 2021.A 4-year-old girl from Texas with fever initially diagnosed as viral gastroenteritis, and then urinary tract infection, ended up in the ICU with septic shock and meningoencephalitis. She got antibiotics and methylprednisolone as well but respiratory and neurologic status continued to decline until her lower respiratory culture pointed to burkholderia bacteria. IV meropenem, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole worked but she remained nonverbal and dependent on a wheelchair at 3 months post-discharge.A Minnesota man sent to the emergency department with altered mental status and weakness was initially diagnosed with acute metabolic encephalopathy and mild degeneration of his hip. When he returned with fever and respiratory problems, he was treated for pneumonia and acute inflammation in his hip. Culture of the joint aspirate turned up burkholderia bacteria. Despite antibiotic treatment, his mental status didn't recover and his hip joint had evidence of osteonecrosis.The CDC had been working with state health departments to try to figure out what was going on but there were no clues from the many household cleaners and personal care products examined as potential sources of infection, as CNN had reported last fall after the initial CDC description of the cases.It was the fourth case that cracked it: a 5-year-old boy in Georgia who came to the emergency department with fever, weakness, tongue swelling, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting. He developed respiratory problems after admission and was treated for presumptive COVID-19 and possible superimposed bacterial infection. After 4 days, he was discovered to have had a large cerebral infarct and died that day. Autopsy turned up disseminated melioidosis with B. pseudomallei in the lungs, liver, and brain as well as SARS-CoV-2.\"They had tested several hundred specimens and it looked like it was coming to a dead end,\" CDC epidemiologist Jennifer McQuiston, DVM, (thanked in the NEJM paper for her role in the investigation) had told CNN. But when the team tried a second, last-ditch search at the boy's home, \"they collected a specimen from an air freshener bottle that had not been collected the first time around.\"Bingo.Better Homes & Gardens' \"Lavender & Chamomile with Gemstones\" essential oil room spray imported from India (now under recall) was found in all four cases and all carried the same B. pseudomallei strain, dubbed ATS2021 for \"aromatherapy spray 2021.\"Gee's group noted that there have been other melioidosis cases in the U.S. in recent years, and not just related to travel. A 2019 case came from the patient's aquarium; others have come from contaminated wound-irrigation fluids and hand cleaners. Some reports suggest that B. pseudomallei could be endemic in the southern U.S.\"Melioidosis is an emerging infectious disease in the United States,\" Gee and colleagues concluded.In addition to considering it in patients with compatible illness, regardless of travel history, they suggested that \"patients who have acute respiratory or neurologic symptoms that do not have a response to initial treatment may be candidates for closer assessment for melioidosis.\"The specimens to culture should be guided by the clinical syndrome, whether blood, sputum, urine, joint aspirate, or cerebrospinal fluid. However, the laboratory should be informed if melioidosis is suspected so that staff can protect themselves from exposure, as some procedures may aerosolize particles.Also, two of the cases were initially misdiagnosed as a different burkholderia species using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or Vitek 2 instrument gene sequencing.\"Health care providers are encouraged to reevaluate patients with isolates identified by automated systems as burkholderia species (specifically B. cepacia and B. thailandensis), Chromobacterium violaceum, Ochrobactrum anthropi, and possibly aeromonas species, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas species in order to assess for possible infection with B. pseudomallei,\" Gee's group cautioned.And of course, report it to public health officials if found, they added.Crystal Phend is a contributing editor at MedPage Today.

Animals most likely to transmit rabies in the United States include bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons and skunks.Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms of rabies, the disease is almost always fatal. Initial symptoms may be similar to the flu, but later ones may include agitation, anxiety, confusion, hyperactivity, difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation, hallucinations and partial paralysis.It is recommended that exposed individuals see a health care provider as soon as possible to be evaluated for rabies post-exposure.Parents can call Riverside County Public Health at 951-358-5107 for any questions.Ema Sasic covers health in the Coachella Valley.

  "main_text": "Tuesday, 15 March01 MarWestern Cape healthcare workers were baffled when a\n7-year-old girl had symptoms of fever, seizures and diarrhoea for nearly two\nmonths.In its monthly communiqu\u00e9, the National Institute\nfor Communicable Diseases (NICD) said the girl first went for a check-up in\nDecember after having two seizures at home. She had a third one at a local\nclinic.The NICD said:But, about two weeks later, she went to the\nhospital again for diarrhoea and vomiting. Her temperature was 39.8\u00b0C, and she\nwas discharged after being given oral rehydration therapy.Three days later, she was back at the hospital with\nongoing vomiting and fever. They performed an electroencephalogram (EEG) on her\nto check if she might have epilepsy. Her blood work, the NICD said, showed\nanaemia, thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), and the presence of\nmalaria parasites, with a subsequent diagnosis of cerebral malaria.\"She commenced IV artesunate and recovered\nfully. As she had no recent history of travel to a malaria-endemic area, her\nillness was termed odyssean malaria.\"Precautionary advisoryThe NICD said a full environmental investigation\nwas done to try and figure out how she got the disease.It said:According to the NICD, odyssean malaria is also\nknown as airport, suitcase, minibus, or taxi-rank malaria. It is likely that a malaria\nvector mosquito, accidentally transported from a malaria area, was responsible.This is not the first time someone with no history\nof travel has been infected with malaria. In 2017, four cases of malaria were\nreported in Kilner Park, Pretoria, affecting people with no recent history of\ntravel. At the time, the NICD said that between 2007 and 2017, over 69 cases of\nodyssean malaria had been reported in the country, mostly in Gauteng.The NICD said as a precautionary measure,\nhealthcare facilities in the district were advised to be suspicious of malaria\nin individuals presenting with \"flu-like illnesses\".\"This presentation of delayed diagnosis of\nmalaria, as well as complicated malaria, is typical in odyssean malaria cases.\nHealthcare workers should check for malaria in patients with recurrent\nunexplained pyrexia even with no history of travel, to prevent delayed\ndiagnosis and subsequent complications.\"We want to\nhear your views on the news.\u00a0Subscribe to News24\u00a0to be part of the\nconversation in the comments section of this article.14 MarThe One Story - DailyThe one story you shouldn't miss today, straight to your inbox.12 Mar31 Dec 202125 Jun 202111 Dec 202110 Dec 202104 Dec 202107 Mar07 Mar11 Nov 201905 MarContact the public editor with feedback for our journalists, complaints, queries or suggestions about articles on News24.",

The samples are being verified at the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00b4s National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa.Three previous cases were found in Dubois County and two in Greene County. Cases have also been detected in Michigan, in a backyard flock and in a zoo.Pending test results should indicate if it is the same strain of the virus that has been found elsewhere and if it is highly pathogenic.Officials have begun euthanizing the 16,500 birds at the latest farm to prevent the spread of the disease.Animal Health Board staff have reached out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the area to schedule testing of birds there, it said.The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S.The turkey infections are the first confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has said.A January 2016 outbreak of bird flu in Dubois County affected 11 poultry farms, resulting in the loss of more than 400,000 birds, the Animal Health Board said.Indiana ranks third nationally in turkey production.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group",

There is always more that can be done to protect your birds.\u201cI urge everyone to leave no stone unturned. Once again review all the measures in place and identify any areas for improvement.\"Think about risks from direct contact with wild birds, especially waterfowl and also anything that could be contaminated by bird droppings \u2013 clothing and footwear, equipment, vehicles, feed and bedding. Make improvements where you can to prevent further spread of this devastating disease within our domestic bird population.\"By Dominic Robertson@DRobertson_StarChief Reporter",
